You shall mark out your eastern border from Hazar Enan to Shepham the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain the border shall go down and reach to the eastern side of the Sea of Chinnereth the border shall go down along the Jordan and it shall end at the Salt Sea
This shall be your land with its surrounding boundaries
Then Moses commanded the children of Israel saying This is the land which you shall inherit by lot which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half tribe
For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers have received their inheritance and the half tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance
The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan across from Jericho eastward toward the sunrise
And the LORD spoke to Moses saying These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you as an inheritance Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun
And you shall take one leader of every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance
These are the names of the men from the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh from the tribe of the children of Simeon Shemuel the son of Ammihud from the tribe of Benjamin Elidad the son of Chislon a leader from the tribe of the children of Dan Bukki the son of Jogli from the sons of Joseph a leader from the tribe of the children of Manasseh Hanniel the son of Ephod and a leader from the tribe of the children of Ephraim Kemuel the son of Shiphtan a leader from the tribe of the children of Zebulun Elizaphan the son of Parnach a leader from the tribe of the children of Issachar Pal el the son of Azzan a leader from the tribe of the children of Asher Ahihud the son of Shelomi and a leader from the tribe of the children of Naphtali Pedahel the son of Ammihud
These are the ones the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance among the children of Israel in the land of Canaan
And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho saying Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites ci es to dwell in from the inheritance of their possession and you shall also give the Levites common land around the ci es
They shall have the ci es to dwell in and their common land shall be for their ca le for their herds and for all their animals
The common land of the ci es which you shall give the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around
And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits on the south side two thousand cubits on the west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand cubits
The city shall be in the middle
This shall belong to them as common land for the ci es
Now among the ci es which you will give to the Levites you shall appoint six ci es of refuge to which a manslayer may flee
And to these you shall add forty two ci es
So all the ci es you will give to the Levites shall be forty eight these you shall give with their common land
And the ci es which you will give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel from the larger tribe you shall give many from the smaller you shall give few
Each shall give some of its ci es to the Levites in propor on to the inheritance that each receives
Then the LORD spoke to Moses saying Speak to the children of Israel and say to them When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan then you shall appoint ci es to be ci es of refuge for you that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally may flee there
They shall be ci es of refuge for you from the avenger that the manslayer may not die un l he stands before the congrega on in judgment
And of the ci es which you give you shall have six ci es of refuge
You shall appoint three ci es on this side of the Jordan and three ci es you shall appoint in the land of Canaan which will be ci es of refuge
These six ci es shall be for refuge for the children of Israel for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee there
But if he strikes him with an iron implement so that he dies he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand by which one could die and he does die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
Or if he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon by which one could die and he does die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
The avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death when he meets him he shall put him to death
If he pushes him out of hatred or while lying in wait hurls something at him so that he dies or in enmity he strikes him with his hand so that he dies the one who struck him shall surely be put to death
He is a murderer
The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him
However if he pushes him suddenly without enmity or throws anything at him without lying in wait or uses a stone by which a man could die throwing it at him without seeing him so that he dies while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm then the congrega on shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments
So the congrega on shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood and the congrega on shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled and he shall remain there un l the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil
But if the manslayer at any me goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled and the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in his city of refuge un l the death of the high priest
But a er the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession
And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your genera ons in all your dwellings
Whoever kills a person the murderer shall be put to death on the tes mony of witnesses but one witness is not sufficient tes mony against a person for the death penalty
Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death
And you shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest
So you shall not pollute the land where you are for blood defiles the land and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it except by the blood of him who shed it
Therefore do not defile the land which you inhabit in the midst of which I dwell for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel
Now the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the families of the sons of Joseph came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders the chief fathers of the children of Israel
And they said The LORD commanded my lord Moses to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters
Now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance
And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
Then Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD saying What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right
This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad saying Let them marry whom they think best but they may marry only within the family of their father s tribe
So the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not change hands from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of Israel shall keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife of one of the family of her father s tribe so that the children of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers
Thus no inheritance shall change hands from one tribe to another but every tribe of the children of Israel shall keep its own inheritance
Just as the LORD commanded Moses so did the daughters of Zelophehad for Mahlah Tirzah Hoglah Milcah and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad were married to the sons of their father s brothers
They were married into the families of the children of Manasseh the son of Joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father s family
These are the commandments and the judgments which the LORD commanded the children of Israel by the hand of Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho
Deuteronomy These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness in the plain opposite Suph between Paran Tophel Laban Hazeroth and Dizahab
It is eleven days journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea
Now it came to pass in the for eth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him as commandments to them a er he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei
On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law saying The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb saying You have dwelt long enough at this mountain
Turn and take your journey and go to the mountains of the Amorites to all the neighboring places in the plain in the mountains and in the lowland in the South and on the seacoast to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon as far as the great river the River Euphrates
See I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give to them and their descendants a er them
And I spoke to you at that me saying I alone am not able to bear you
The LORD your God has mul plied you and here you are today as the stars of heaven in mul tude
May the LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand mes more numerous than you are and bless you as He has promised you How can I alone bear your problems and your burdens and your complaints Choose wise understanding and knowledgeable men from among your tribes and I will make them heads over you
And you answered me and said The thing which you have told us to do is good
So I took the heads of your tribes wise and knowledgeable men and made them heads over you leaders of thousands leaders of hundreds leaders of fi ies leaders of tens and officers for your tribes
Then I commanded your judges at that me saying Hear the cases between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him
You shall not show par ality in judgment you shall hear the small as well as the great you shall not be afraid in any man s presence for the judgment is God s
The case that is too hard for you bring to me and I will hear it
And I commanded you at that me all the things which you should do
So we departed from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites as the LORD our God had commanded us
Then we came to Kadesh Barnea
And I said to you You have come to the mountains of the Amorites which the LORD our God is giving us
Look the LORD your God has set the land before you go up and possess it as the LORD God of your fathers has spoken to you do not fear or be discouraged
And everyone of you came near to me and said Let us send men before us and let them search out the land for us and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up and of the ci es into which we shall come
The plan pleased me well so I took twelve of your men one man from each tribe
And they departed and went up into the mountains and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out
They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us and they brought back word to us saying It is a good land which the LORD our God is giving us
Nevertheless you would not go up but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God and you complained in your tents and said Because the LORD hates us He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us
Where can we go up Our brethren have discouraged our hearts saying The people are greater and taller than we the ci es are great and for fied up to heaven moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there
Then I said to you Do not be terrified or afraid of them
The LORD your God who goes before you He will fight for you according to all He did for you in Egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you as a man carries his son in all the way that you went un l you came to this place
Yet for all that you did not believe the LORD your God who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to pitch your tents to show you the way you should go in the fire by night and in the cloud by day
And the LORD heard the sound of your words and was angry and took an oath saying Surely not one of these men of this evil genera on shall see that good land of which I swore to give to your fathers except Caleb the son of Jephunneh he shall see it and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked because he wholly followed the LORD
The LORD was also angry with me for your sakes saying Even you shall not go in there Joshua the son of Nun who stands before you he shall go in there
Encourage him for he shall cause Israel to inherit it
Moreover your li le ones and your children who you say will be vic ms who today have no knowledge of good and evil they shall go in there to them I will give it and they shall possess it
But as for you turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea
Then you answered and said to me We have sinned against the LORD we will go up and fight just as the LORD our God commanded us
And when everyone of you had girded on his weapons of war you were ready to go up into the mountain
And the LORD said to me Tell them Do not go up nor fight for I am not among you lest you be defeated before your enemies
So I spoke to you yet you would not listen but rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the mountain
And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do and drove you back from Seir to Hormah
Then you returned and wept before the LORD but the LORD would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you
So you remained in Kadesh many days according to the days that you spent there
Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness of the Way of the Red Sea as the LORD spoke to me and we skirted Mount Seir for many days
And the LORD spoke to me saying You have skirted this mountain long enough turn northward
And command the people saying You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren the descendants of Esau who live in Seir and they will be afraid of you
Therefore watch yourselves carefully
Do not meddle with them for I will not give you any of their land no not so much as one footstep because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession
You shall buy food from them with money that you may eat and you shall also buy water from them with money that you may drink
For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand
He knows your trudging through this great wilderness
These forty years the LORD your God has been with you you have lacked nothing
And when we passed beyond our brethren the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir away from the road of the plain away from Elath and Ezion Geber we turned and passed by way of the Wilderness of Moab
Then the LORD said to me Do not harass Moab nor contend with them in ba le for I will not give you any of their land as a possession because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession
The Emim had dwelt there in mes past a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim
They were also regarded as giants like the Anakim but the Moabites call them Emim
The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their place just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave them
Now rise and cross over the Valley of the Zered
So we crossed over the Valley of the Zered
And the me we took to come from Kadesh Barnea un l we crossed over the Valley of the Zered was thirty eight years un l all the genera on of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp just as the LORD had sworn to them
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp un l they were consumed
So it was when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people that the LORD spoke to me saying This day you are to cross over at Ar the boundary of Moab
And when you come near the people of Ammon do not harass them or meddle with them for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession
That was also regarded as a land of giants giants formerly dwelt there
But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim
But the LORD destroyed them before them and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who dwelt in Seir when He destroyed the Horites from before them
They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place even to this day
And the Avim who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their place
Rise take your journey and cross over the River Arnon
Look I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his land
Begin to possess it and engage him in ba le
This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the na ons under the whole heaven who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you
And I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace saying Let me pass through your land I will keep strictly to the road and I will turn neither to the right nor to the le
You shall sell me food for money that I may eat and give me water for money that I may drink only let me pass through on foot just as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me un l I cross the Jordan to the land which the LORD our God is giving us
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obs nate that He might deliver him into your hand as it is this day
And the LORD said to me See I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you
Begin to possess it that you may inherit his land
Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz
And the LORD our God delivered him over to us so we defeated him his sons and all his people
We took all his ci es at that me and we u erly destroyed the men women and li le ones of every city we le none remaining
We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves with the spoil of the ci es which we took
From Aroer which is on the bank of the River Arnon and from the city that is in the ravine as far as Gilead there was not one city too strong for us the LORD our God delivered all to us
Only you did not go near the land of the people of Ammon anywhere along the River Jabbok or to the ci es of the mountains or wherever the LORD our God had forbidden us
Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan and Og king of Bashan came out against us he and all his people to ba le at Edrei
And the LORD said to me Do not fear him for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon
So the LORD our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan with all his people and we a acked him un l he had no survivors remaining
And we took all his ci es at that me there was not a city which we did not take from them sixty ci es all the region of Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan
All these ci es were for fied with high walls gates and bars besides a great many rural towns
And we u erly destroyed them as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon u erly destroying the men women and children of every city
But all the livestock and the spoil of the ci es we took as booty for ourselves
And at that me we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were on this side of the Jordan from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion and the Amorites call it Senir all the ci es of the plain all Gilead and all Bashan as far as Salcah and Edrei ci es of the kingdom of Og in Bashan
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants
Indeed his bedstead was an iron bedstead
Is it not in Rabbah of the people of Ammon Nine cubits is its length and four cubits its width according to the standard cubit
And this land which we possessed at that me from Aroer which is by the River Arnon and half the mountains of Gilead and its ci es I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites
The rest of Gilead and all Bashan the kingdom of Og I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh
All the region of Argob with all Bashan was called the land of the giants
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites and called Bashan a er his own name Havoth Jair to this day
Also I gave Gilead to Machir
And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon the middle of the river as the border as far as the River Jabbok the border of the people of Ammon the plain also with the Jordan as the border from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the Sea of the Arabah the Salt Sea below the slopes of Pisgah
Then I commanded you at that me saying The LORD your God has given you this land to possess
All you men of valor shall cross over armed before your brethren the children of Israel
But your wives your li le ones and your livestock I know that you have much livestock shall stay in your ci es which I have given you un l the LORD has given rest to your brethren as to you and they also possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them beyond the Jordan
Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you
And I commanded Joshua at that me saying Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings so will the LORD do to all the kingdoms through which you pass
You must not fear them for the LORD your God Himself fights for you
Then I pleaded with the LORD at that me saying O Lord GOD You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do anything like Your works and Your mighty deeds I pray let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan those pleasant mountains and Lebanon
But the LORD was angry with me on your account and would not listen to me
So the LORD said to me Enough of that Speak no more to Me of this ma er
Go up to the top of Pisgah and li your eyes toward the west the north the south and the east behold it with your eyes for you shall not cross over this Jordan
But command Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see
So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor
Now O Israel listen to the statutes and the judgments which I teach you to observe that you may live and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers is giving you
You shall not add to the word which I command you nor take from it that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you
Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal Peor for the LORD your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor
But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today every one of you
Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me that you should act according to them in the land which you go to possess
Therefore be careful to observe them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say Surely this great na on is a wise and understanding people
For what great na on is there that has God so near to it as the LORD our God is to us for whatever reason we may call upon Him And what great na on is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this law which I set before you this day Only take heed to yourself and diligently keep yourself lest you forget the things your eyes have seen and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life
And teach them to your children and your grandchildren especially concerning the day you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb when the LORD said to me Gather the people to Me and I will let them hear My words that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth and that they may teach their children
Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven with darkness cloud and thick darkness
And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire
You heard the sound of the words but saw no form you only heard a voice
So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform the Ten Commandments and He wrote them on two tablets of stone
And the LORD commanded me at that me to teach you statutes and judgments that you might observe them in the land which you cross over to possess
Take careful heed to yourselves for you saw no form when the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure the likeness of male or female the likeness of any animal that is on the earth or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or the likeness of any fish that is in the water beneath the earth
And take heed lest you li your eyes to heaven and when you see the sun the moon and the stars all the host of heaven you feel driven to worship them and serve them which the LORD your God has given to all the peoples under the whole heaven as a heritage
But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace out of Egypt to be His people an inheritance as you are this day
Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and swore that I would not cross over the Jordan and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance
But I must die in this land I must not cross over the Jordan but you shall cross over and possess that good land
Take heed to yourselves lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which the LORD your God has forbidden you
For the LORD your God is a consuming fire a jealous God
When you beget children and grandchildren and have grown old in the land and act corruptly and make a carved image in the form of anything and do evil in the sight of the LORD your God to provoke Him to anger I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that you will soon u erly perish from the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess you will not prolong your days in it but will be u erly destroyed
And the LORD will sca er you among the peoples and you will be le few in number among the na ons where the LORD will drive you
And there you will serve gods the work of men s hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell
But from there you will seek the LORD your God and you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul
When you are in distress and all these things come upon you in the la er days when you turn to the LORD your God and obey His voice for the LORD your God is a merciful God He will not forsake you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them
For ask now concerning the days that are past which were before you since the day that God created man on the earth and ask from one end of heaven to the other whether any great thing like this has happened or anything like it has been heard
Did any people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire as you have heard and live Or did God ever try to go and take for Himself a na on from the midst of another na on by trials by signs by wonders by war by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and by great terrors according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD Himself is God there is none other besides Him
Out of heaven He let you hear His voice that He might instruct you on earth He showed you His great fire and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire
And because He loved your fathers therefore He chose their descendants a er them and He brought you out of Egypt with His Presence with His mighty power driving out from before you na ons greater and migh er than you to bring you in to give you their land as an inheritance as it is this day
Therefore know this day and consider it in your heart that the LORD Himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath there is no other
You shall therefore keep His statutes and His commandments which I command you today that it may go well with you and with your children a er you and that you may prolong your days in the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all me
Then Moses set apart three ci es on this side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun that the manslayer might flee there who kills his neighbor uninten onally without having hated him in me past and that by fleeing to one of these ci es he might live Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites
Now this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel
These are the tes monies the statutes and the judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel a er they came out of Egypt on this side of the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth Peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon whom Moses and the children of Israel defeated a er they came out of Egypt
And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan two kings of the Amorites who were on this side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun from Aroer which is on the bank of the River Arnon even to Mount Sion that is Hermon and all the plain on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah below the slopes of Pisgah
And Moses called all Israel and said to them Hear O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your hearing today that you may learn them and be careful to observe them
The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb
The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers but with us those who are here today all of us who are alive
The LORD talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire
I stood between the LORD and you at that me to declare to you the word of the LORD for you were afraid because of the fire and you did not go up the mountain
He said I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage
You shall have no other gods before Me
You shall not make for yourself a carved image any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down to them nor serve them
For I the LORD your God am a jealous God visi ng the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth genera ons of those who hate Me but showing mercy to thousands to those who love Me and keep My commandments
You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain
Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy as the LORD your God commanded you
Six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God
In it you shall do no work you nor your son nor your daughter nor your male servant nor your female servant nor your ox nor your donkey nor any of your ca le nor your stranger who is within your gates that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you
And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day
Honor your father and your mother as the LORD your God has commanded you that your days may be long and that it may be well with you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you
You shall not murder
You shall not commit adultery
You shall not steal
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor
You shall not covet your neighbor s wife and you shall not desire your neighbor s house his field his male servant his female servant his ox his donkey or anything that is your neighbor s
These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mountain from the midst of the fire the cloud and the thick darkness with a loud voice and He added no more
And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me
So it was when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire that you came near to me all the heads of your tribes and your elders
And you said Surely the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire
We have seen this day that God speaks with man yet he s ll lives
Now therefore why should we die For this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the LORD our God anymore then we shall die
For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire as we have and lived You go near and hear all that the LORD our God may say and tell us all that the LORD our God says to you and we will hear and do it
Then the LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me and the LORD said to me I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you
They are right in all that they have spoken
Oh that they had such a heart in them that they would fear Me and always keep all My commandments that it might be well with them and with their children forever Go and say to them Return to your tents
But as for you stand here by Me and I will speak to you all the commandments the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them that they may observe them in the land which I am giving them to possess
Therefore you shall be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the le
You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you that you may live and that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess
Now this is the commandment and these are the statutes and judgments which the LORD your God has commanded to teach you that you may observe them in the land which you are crossing over to possess that you may fear the LORD your God to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you you and your son and your grandson all the days of your life and that your days may be prolonged
Therefore hear O Israel and be careful to observe it that it may be well with you and that you may mul ply greatly as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you a land flowing with milk and honey
Hear O Israel The LORD our God the LORD is one You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your strength
And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart
You shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house when you walk by the way when you lie down and when you rise up
You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes
You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates
So it shall be when the LORD your God brings you into the land of which He swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give you large and beau ful ci es which you did not build houses full of all good things which you did not fill hewn out wells which you did not dig vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant when you have eaten and are full then beware lest you forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage
You shall fear the LORD your God and serve Him and shall take oaths in His name
You shall not go a er other gods the gods of the peoples who are all around you for the LORD your God is a jealous God among you lest the anger of the LORD your God be aroused against you and destroy you from the face of the earth
You shall not tempt the LORD your God as you tempted Him in Massah
You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God His tes monies and His statutes which He has commanded you
And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to cast out all your enemies from before you as the LORD has spoken
When your son asks you in me to come saying What is the meaning of the tes monies the statutes and the judgments which the LORD our God has commanded you then you shall say to your son We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and the LORD showed signs and wonders before our eyes great and severe against Egypt Pharaoh and all his household
Then He brought us out from there that He might bring us in to give us the land of which He swore to our fathers
And the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes to fear the LORD our God for our good always that He might preserve us alive as it is this day
Then it will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all these commandments before the LORD our God as He has commanded us
When the LORD your God brings you into the land which you go to possess and has cast out many na ons before you the Hi tes and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites seven na ons greater and migh er than you and when the LORD your God delivers them over to you you shall conquer them and u erly destroy them
You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them
Nor shall you make marriages with them
You shall not give your daughter to their son nor take their daughter for your son
For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods so the anger of the LORD will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly
But thus you shall deal with them you shall destroy their altars and break down their sacred pillars and cut down their wooden images and burn their carved images with fire
For you are a holy people to the LORD your God the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth
The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people for you were the least of all peoples but because the LORD loves you and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of bondage from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt
Therefore know that the LORD your God He is God the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand genera ons with those who love Him and keep His commandments and He repays those who hate Him to their face to destroy them
He will not be slack with him who hates Him He will repay him to his face
Therefore you shall keep the commandment the statutes and the judgments which I command you today to observe them
Then it shall come to pass because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them that the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers
And He will love you and bless you and mul ply you He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land your grain and your new wine and your oil the increase of your ca le and the offspring of your flock in the land of which He swore to your fathers to give you
You shall be blessed above all peoples there shall not be a male or female barren among you or among your livestock
And the LORD will take away from you all sickness and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known but will lay them on all those who hate you
And you shall destroy all the peoples whom the LORD your God delivers over to you your eye shall have no pity on them nor shall you serve their gods for that will be a snare to you
If you should say in your heart These na ons are greater than I how can I dispossess them you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt the great trials which your eyes saw the signs and the wonders the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out
So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid
Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet among them un l those who are le who hide themselves from you are destroyed
You shall not be terrified of them for the LORD your God the great and awesome God is among you
And the LORD your God will drive out those na ons before you li le by li le you will be unable to destroy them at once lest the beasts of the field become too numerous for you
But the LORD your God will deliver them over to you and will inflict defeat upon them un l they are destroyed
And He will deliver their kings into your hand and you will destroy their name from under heaven no one shall be able to stand against you un l you have destroyed them
You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them nor take it for yourselves lest you be snared by it for it is an abomina on to the LORD your God
Nor shall you bring an abomina on into your house lest you be doomed to destruc on like it
You shall u erly detest it and u erly abhor it for it is an accursed thing
Every commandment which I command you today you must be careful to observe that you may live and mul ply and go in and possess the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers
And you shall remember that the LORD your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness to humble you and test you to know what was in your heart whether you would keep His commandments or not
So He humbled you allowed you to hunger and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the LORD
Your garments did not wear out on you nor did your foot swell these forty years
You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son so the LORD your God chastens you
Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to fear Him
For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and springs that flow out of valleys and hills a land of wheat and barley of vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity in which you will lack nothing a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper
When you have eaten and are full then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you
Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments His judgments and His statutes which I command you today lest when you have eaten and are full and have built beau ful houses and dwell in them and when your herds and your flocks mul ply and your silver and your gold are mul plied and all that you have is mul plied when your heart is li ed up and you forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who led you through that great and terrible wilderness in which were fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty land where there was no water who brought water for you out of the flinty rock who fed you in the wilderness with manna which your fathers did not know that He might humble you and that He might test you to do you good in the end then you say in your heart My power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth
And you shall remember the LORD your God for it is He who gives you power to get wealth that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers as it is this day
Then it shall be if you by any means forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and serve them and worship them I tes fy against you this day that you shall surely perish
As the na ons which the LORD destroys before you so you shall perish because you would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God
Hear O Israel You are to cross over the Jordan today and go in to dispossess na ons greater and migh er than yourself ci es great and for fied up to heaven a people great and tall the descendants of the Anakim whom you know and of whom you heard it said Who can stand before the descendants of Anak Therefore understand today that the LORD your God is He who goes over before you as a consuming fire
He will destroy them and bring them down before you so you shall drive them out and destroy them quickly as the LORD has said to you
Do not think in your heart a er the LORD your God has cast them out before you saying Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land but it is because of the wickedness of these na ons that the LORD is driving them out from before you
It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you go in to possess their land but because of the wickedness of these na ons that the LORD your God drives them out from before you and that He may fulfill the word which the LORD swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Therefore understand that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness for you are a s ff necked people
Remember Do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness
From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt un l you came to this place you have been rebellious against the LORD
Also in Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath so that the LORD was angry enough with you to have destroyed you
When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with you then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights
I neither ate bread nor drank water
Then the LORD delivered to me two tablets of stone wri en with the finger of God and on them were all the words which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant
Then the LORD said to me Arise go down quickly from here for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them they have made themselves a molded image
Furthermore the LORD spoke to me saying I have seen this people and indeed they are a s ff necked people
Let Me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and I will make of you a na on migh er and greater than they
So I turned and came down from the mountain and the mountain burned with fire and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands
And I looked and behold you had sinned against the LORD your God had made for yourselves a molded calf You had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you
Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes
And I fell down before the LORD as at the first forty days and forty nights I neither ate bread nor drank water because of all your sin which you commi ed in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger
For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was angry with you to destroy you
But the LORD listened to me at that me also
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him so I prayed for Aaron also at the same me
Then I took your sin the calf which you had made and burned it with fire and crushed it and ground it very small un l it was as fine as dust and I threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain
Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Ha aavah you provoked the LORD to wrath
Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh Barnea saying Go up and possess the land which I have given you then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice
You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you
Thus I prostrated myself before the LORD forty days and forty nights I kept prostra ng myself because the LORD had said He would destroy you
Therefore I prayed to the LORD and said O Lord GOD do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand
Remember Your servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob do not look on the stubbornness of this people or on their wickedness or their sin lest the land from which You brought us should say Because the LORD was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness
Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm
At that me the LORD said to me Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of wood
And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke and you shall put them in the ark
So I made an ark of acacia wood hewed two tablets of stone like the first and went up the mountain having the two tablets in my hand
And He wrote on the tablets according to the first wri ng the Ten Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the LORD gave them to me
Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made and there they are just as the LORD commanded me
Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah where Aaron died and where he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his stead
From there they journeyed to Gudgodah and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah a land of rivers of water
At that me the LORD separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister to Him and to bless in His name to this day
Therefore Levi has no por on nor inheritance with his brethren the LORD is his inheritance just as the LORD your God promised him
As at the first me I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights the LORD also heard me at that me and the LORD chose not to destroy you
Then the LORD said to me Arise begin your journey before the people that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them
And now Israel what does the LORD your God require of you but to fear the LORD your God to walk in all His ways and to love Him to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and to keep the commandments of the LORD and His statutes which I command you today for your good Indeed heaven and the highest heavens belong to the LORD your God also the earth with all that is in it
The LORD delighted only in your fathers to love them and He chose their descendants a er them you above all peoples as it is this day
Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart and be s ff necked no longer
For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great God mighty and awesome who shows no par ality nor takes a bribe
He administers jus ce for the fatherless and the widow and loves the stranger giving him food and clothing
Therefore love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt
You shall fear the LORD your God you shall serve Him and to Him you shall hold fast and take oaths in His name
He is your praise and He is your God who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen
Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy persons and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven in mul tude
Therefore you shall love the LORD your God and keep His charge His statutes His judgments and His commandments always
Know today that I do not speak with your children who have not known and who have not seen the chastening of the LORD your God His greatness and His mighty hand and His outstretched arm His signs and His acts which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to all his land what He did to the army of Egypt to their horses and their chariots how He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day what He did for you in the wilderness un l you came to this place and what He did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up their households their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel but your eyes have seen every great act of the LORD which He did
Therefore you shall keep every commandment which I command you today that you may be strong and go in and possess the land which you cross over to possess and that you may prolong your days in the land which the LORD swore to give your fathers to them and their descendants a land flowing with milk and honey
For the land which you go to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come where you sowed your seed and watered it by foot as a vegetable garden but the land which you cross over to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of heaven a land for which the LORD your God cares the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year
And it shall be that if you earnestly obey My commandments which I command you today to love the LORD your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul then I will give you the rain for your land in its season the early rain and the la er rain that you may gather in your grain your new wine and your oil
And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock that you may eat and be filled
Take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them lest the LORD S anger be aroused against you and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain and the land yield no produce and you perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you
Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul and bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes
You shall teach them to your children speaking of them when you sit in your house when you walk by the way when you lie down and when you rise up
And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates that your days and the days of your children may be mul plied in the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them like the days of the heavens above the earth
For if you carefully keep all these commandments which I command you to do to love the LORD your God to walk in all His ways and to hold fast to Him then the LORD will drive out all these na ons from before you and you will dispossess greater and migh er na ons than yourselves
Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours from the wilderness and Lebanon from the river the River Euphrates even to the Western Sea shall be your territory
No man shall be able to stand against you the LORD your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread just as He has said to you
Behold I set before you today a blessing and a curse the blessing if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you today and the curse if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God but turn aside from the way which I command you today to go a er other gods which you have not known
Now it shall be when the LORD your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal
Are they not on the other side of the Jordan toward the se ng sun in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal beside the terebinth trees of Moreh For you will cross over the Jordan and go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you and you will possess it and dwell in it
And you shall be careful to observe all the statutes and judgments which I set before you today
These are the statutes and judgments which you shall be careful to observe in the land which the LORD God of your fathers is giving you to possess all the days that you live on the earth
You shall u erly destroy all the places where the na ons which you shall dispossess served their gods on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree
And you shall destroy their altars break their sacred pillars and burn their wooden images with fire you shall cut down the carved images of their gods and destroy their names from that place
You shall not worship the LORD your God with such things
But you shall seek the place where the LORD your God chooses out of all your tribes to put His name for His dwelling place and there you shall go
There you shall take your burnt offerings your sacrifices your thes the heave offerings of your hand your vowed offerings your freewill offerings and the firstborn of your herds and flocks
And there you shall eat before the LORD your God and you shall rejoice in all to which you have put your hand you and your households in which the LORD your God has blessed you
You shall not at all do as we are doing here today every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes for as yet you have not come to the rest and the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you
But when you cross over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about so that you dwell in safety then there will be the place where the LORD your God chooses to make His name abide
There you shall bring all that I command you your burnt offerings your sacrifices your thes the heave offerings of your hand and all your choice offerings which you vow to the LORD
And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God you and your sons and your daughters your male and female servants and the Levite who is within your gates since he has no por on nor inheritance with you
Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes there you shall offer your burnt offerings and there you shall do all that I command you
However you may slaughter and eat meat within all your gates whatever your heart desires according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you the unclean and the clean may eat of it of the gazelle and the deer alike
Only you shall not eat the blood you shall pour it on the earth like water
You may not eat within your gates the the of your grain or your new wine or your oil of the firstborn of your herd or your flock of any of your offerings which you vow of your freewill offerings or of the heave offering of your hand
But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God chooses you and your son and your daughter your male servant and your female servant and the Levite who is within your gates and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all to which you put your hands
Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land
When the LORD your God enlarges your border as He has promised you and you say Let me eat meat because you long to eat meat you may eat as much meat as your heart desires
If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you then you may slaughter from your herd and from your flock which the LORD has given you just as I have commanded you and you may eat within your gates as much as your heart desires
Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten so you may eat them the unclean and the clean alike may eat them
Only be sure that you do not eat the blood for the blood is the life you may not eat the life with the meat
You shall not eat it you shall pour it on the earth like water
You shall not eat it that it may go well with you and your children a er you when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD
Only the holy things which you have and your vowed offerings you shall take and go to the place which the LORD chooses
And you shall offer your burnt offerings the meat and the blood on the altar of the LORD your God and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God and you shall eat the meat
Observe and obey all these words which I command you that it may go well with you and your children a er you forever when you do what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God
When the LORD your God cuts off from before you the na ons which you go to dispossess and you displace them and dwell in their land take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them a er they are destroyed from before you and that you do not inquire a er their gods saying How did these na ons serve their gods I also will do likewise
You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way for every abomina on to the LORD which He hates they have done to their gods for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods
Whatever I command you be careful to observe it you shall not add to it nor take away from it
If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder comes to pass of which he spoke to you saying Let us go a er other gods which you have not known and let us serve them you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the LORD your God is tes ng you to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul
You shall walk a er the LORD your God and fear Him and keep His commandments and obey His voice and you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him
But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has spoken in order to turn you away from the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of bondage to en ce you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk
So you shall put away the evil from your midst
If your brother the son of your mother your son or your daughter the wife of your bosom or your friend who is as your own soul secretly en ces you saying Let us go and serve other gods which you have not known neither you nor your fathers of the gods of the people which are all around you near to you or far off from you from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth you shall not consent to him or listen to him nor shall your eye pity him nor shall you spare him or conceal him but you shall surely kill him your hand shall be first against him to put him to death and a erward the hand of all the people
And you shall stone him with stones un l he dies because he sought to en ce you away from the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage
So all Israel shall hear and fear and not again do such wickedness as this among you
If you hear someone in one of your ci es which the LORD your God gives you to dwell in saying Corrupt men have gone out from among you and en ced the inhabitants of their city saying Let us go and serve other gods which you have not known then you shall inquire search out and ask diligently
And if it is indeed true and certain that such an abomina on was commi ed among you you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword u erly destroying it all that is in it and its livestock with the edge of the sword
And you shall gather all its plunder into the middle of the street and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder for the LORD your God
It shall be a heap forever it shall not be built again
So none of the accursed things shall remain in your hand that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy have compassion on you and mul ply you just as He swore to your fathers because you have listened to the voice of the LORD your God to keep all His commandments which I command you today to do what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God
You are the children of the LORD your God you shall not cut yourselves nor shave the front of your head for the dead
For you are a holy people to the LORD your God and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for Himself a special treasure above all the peoples who are on the face of the earth
You shall not eat any detestable thing
These are the animals which you may eat the ox the sheep the goat the deer the gazelle the roe deer the wild goat the mountain goat the antelope and the mountain sheep
And you may eat every animal with cloven hooves having the hoof split into two parts and that chews the cud among the animals
Nevertheless of those that chew the cud or have cloven hooves you shall not eat such as these the camel the hare and the rock hyrax for they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves they are unclean for you
Also the swine is unclean for you because it has cloven hooves yet does not chew the cud you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcasses
These you may eat of all that are in the waters you may eat all that have fins and scales
And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat it is unclean for you
All clean birds you may eat
But these you shall not eat the eagle the vulture the buzzard the red kite the falcon and the kite a er their kinds every raven a er its kind the ostrich the short eared owl the seagull and the hawk a er their kinds the li le owl the screech owl the white owl the jackdaw the carrion vulture the fisher owl the stork the heron a er its kind and the hoopoe and the bat
Also every creeping thing that flies is unclean for you they shall not be eaten
You may eat all clean birds
You shall not eat anything that dies of itself you may give it to the alien who is within your gates that he may eat it or you may sell it to a foreigner for you are a holy people to the LORD your God
You shall not boil a young goat in its mother s milk
You shall truly the all the increase of your grain that the field produces year by year
And you shall eat before the LORD your God in the place where He chooses to make His name abide the the of your grain and your new wine and your oil of the firstborn of your herds and your flocks that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always
But if the journey is too long for you so that you are not able to carry the the or if the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you when the LORD your God has blessed you then you shall exchange it for money take the money in your hand and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses
And you shall spend that money for whatever your heart desires for oxen or sheep for wine or similar drink for whatever your heart desires you shall eat there before the LORD your God and you shall rejoice you and your household
You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates for he has no part nor inheritance with you
At the end of every third year you shall bring out the the of your produce of that year and store it up within your gates
And the Levite because he has no por on nor inheritance with you and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates may come and eat and be sa sfied that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do
At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release of debts
And this is the form of the release Every creditor who has lent anything to his neighbor shall release it he shall not require it of his neighbor or his brother because it is called the LORD S release
Of a foreigner you may require it but you shall give up your claim to what is owed by your brother except when there may be no poor among you for the LORD will greatly bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance only if you carefully obey the voice of the LORD your God to observe with care all these commandments which I command you today
For the LORD your God will bless you just as He promised you you shall lend to many na ons but you shall not borrow you shall reign over many na ons but they shall not reign over you
If there is among you a poor man of your brethren within any of the gates in your land which the LORD your God is giving you you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother but you shall open your hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient for his need whatever he needs
Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart saying The seventh year the year of release is at hand and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing and he cry out to the LORD against you and it become sin among you
You shall surely give to him and your heart should not be grieved when you give to him because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand
For the poor will never cease from the land therefore I command you saying You shall open your hand wide to your brother to your poor and your needy in your land
If your brother a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman is sold to you and serves you six years then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you
And when you send him away free from you you shall not let him go away empty handed you shall supply him liberally from your flock from your threshing floor and from your winepress
From what the LORD your God has blessed you with you shall give to him
You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you therefore I command you this thing today
And if it happens that he says to you I will not go away from you because he loves you and your house since he prospers with you then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his ear to the door and he shall be your servant forever
Also to your female servant you shall do likewise
It shall not seem hard to you when you send him away free from you for he has been worth a double hired servant in serving you six years
Then the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do
All the firstborn males that come from your herd and your flock you shall sanc fy to the LORD your God you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd nor shear the firstborn of your flock
You and your household shall eat it before the LORD your God year by year in the place which the LORD chooses
But if there is a defect in it if it is lame or blind or has any serious defect you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God

And if it is indeed true and certain that such an abomina on has been commi ed in Israel then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has commi ed that wicked thing and shall stone to death that man or woman with stones
Whoever is deserving of death shall be put to death on the tes mony of two or three witnesses he shall not be put to death on the tes mony of one witness
The hands of the witnesses shall be the first against him to put him to death and a erward the hands of all the people
So you shall put away the evil from among you
If a ma er arises which is too hard for you to judge between degrees of guilt for bloodshed between one judgment or another or between one punishment or another ma ers of controversy within your gates then you shall arise and go up to the place which the LORD your God chooses
And you shall come to the priests the Levites and to the judge there in those days and inquire of them they shall pronounce upon you the sentence of judgment
You shall do according to the sentence which they pronounce upon you in that place which the LORD chooses
And you shall be careful to do according to all that they order you
According to the sentence of the law in which they instruct you according to the judgment which they tell you you shall do you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the le from the sentence which they pronounce upon you
Now the man who acts presumptuously and will not heed the priest who stands to minister there before the LORD your God or the judge that man shall die
So you shall put away the evil from Israel
And all the people shall hear and fear and no longer act presumptuously
When you come to the land which the LORD your God is giving you and possess it and dwell in it and say I will set a king over me like all the na ons that are around me you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses one from among your brethren you shall set as king over you you may not set a foreigner over you who is not your brother
But he shall not mul ply horses for himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to mul ply horses for the LORD has said to you You shall not return that way again
Neither shall he mul ply wives for himself lest his heart turn away nor shall he greatly mul ply silver and gold for himself
Also it shall be when he sits on the throne of his kingdom that he shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book from the one before the priests the Levites
And it shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the LORD his God and be careful to observe all the words of this law and these statutes that his heart may not be li ed above his brethren that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the le and that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel
The priests the Levites all the tribe of Levi shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire and His por on
Therefore they shall have no inheritance among their brethren the LORD is their inheritance as He said to them
And this shall be the priest s due from the people from those who offer a sacrifice whether it is bull or sheep they shall give to the priest the shoulder the cheeks and the stomach
The firs ruits of your grain and your new wine and your oil and the first of the fleece of your sheep you shall give him
For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to minister in the name of the LORD him and his sons forever
So if a Levite comes from any of your gates from where he dwells among all Israel and comes with all the desire of his mind to the place which the LORD chooses then he may serve in the name of the LORD his God as all his brethren the Levites do who stand there before the LORD
They shall have equal por ons to eat besides what comes from the sale of his inheritance
When you come into the land which the LORD your God is giving you you shall not learn to follow the abomina ons of those na ons
There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire or one who prac ces witchcra or a soothsayer or one who interprets omens or a sorcerer or one who conjures spells or a medium or a spiri st or one who calls up the dead
For all who do these things are an abomina on to the LORD and because of these abomina ons the LORD your God drives them out from before you
You shall be blameless before the LORD your God
For these na ons which you will dispossess listened to soothsayers and diviners but as for you the LORD your God has not appointed such for you
The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst from your brethren
Him you shall hear according to all you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God nor let me see this great fire anymore lest I die
And the LORD said to me What they have spoken is good
I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren and will put My words in His mouth and He shall speak to them all that I command Him
And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words which He speaks in My name I will require it of him
But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name which I have not commanded him to speak or who speaks in the name of other gods that prophet shall die
And if you say in your heart How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD if the thing does not happen or come to pass that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken the prophet has spoken it presumptuously you shall not be afraid of him
When the LORD your God has cut off the na ons whose land the LORD your God is giving you and you dispossess them and dwell in their ci es and in their houses you shall separate three ci es for yourself in the midst of your land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess
You shall prepare roads for yourself and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit that any manslayer may flee there
And this is the case of the manslayer who flees there that he may live Whoever kills his neighbor uninten onally not having hated him in me past as when a man goes to the woods with his neighbor to cut mber and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies he shall flee to one of these ci es and live lest the avenger of blood while his anger is hot pursue the manslayer and overtake him because the way is long and kill him though he was not deserving of death since he had not hated the vic m in me past
Therefore I command you saying You shall separate three ci es for yourself
Now if the LORD your God enlarges your territory as He swore to your fathers and gives you the land which He promised to give to your fathers and if you keep all these commandments and do them which I command you today to love the LORD your God and to walk always in His ways then you shall add three more ci es for yourself besides these three lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance and thus guilt of bloodshed be upon you
But if anyone hates his neighbor lies in wait for him rises against him and strikes him mortally so that he dies and he flees to one of these ci es then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die
Your eye shall not pity him but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with you
You shall not remove your neighbor s landmark which the men of old have set in your inheritance which you will inherit in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess
One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits by the mouth of two or three witnesses the ma er shall be established
If a false witness rises against any man to tes fy against him of wrongdoing then both men in the controversy shall stand before the LORD before the priests and the judges who serve in those days
And the judges shall make careful inquiry and indeed if the witness is a false witness who has tes fied falsely against his brother then you shall do to him as he thought to have done to his brother so you shall put away the evil from among you
And those who remain shall hear and fear and herea er they shall not again commit such evil among you
Your eye shall not pity life shall be for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
When you go out to ba le against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you do not be afraid of them for the LORD your God is with you who brought you up from the land of Egypt
So it shall be when you are on the verge of ba le that the priest shall approach and speak to the people
And he shall say to them Hear O Israel Today you are on the verge of ba le with your enemies
Do not let your heart faint do not be afraid and do not tremble or be terrified because of them for the LORD your God is He who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you
Then the officers shall speak to the people saying What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it Let him go and return to his house lest he die in the ba le and another man dedicate it
Also what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it Let him go and return to his house lest he die in the ba le and another man eat of it
And what man is there who is betrothed to a woman and has not married her Let him go and return to his house lest he die in the ba le and another man marry her
The officers shall speak further to the people and say What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted Let him go and return to his house lest the heart of his brethren faint like his heart
And so it shall be when the officers have finished speaking to the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people
When you go near a city to fight against it then proclaim an offer of peace to it
And it shall be that if they accept your offer of peace and open to you then all the people who are found in it shall be placed under tribute to you and serve you

And when the LORD your God delivers it into your hands you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword
But the women the li le ones the livestock and all that is in the city all its spoil you shall plunder for yourself and you shall eat the enemies plunder which the LORD your God gives you
Thus you shall do to all the ci es which are very far from you which are not of the ci es of these na ons
But of the ci es of these peoples which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive but you shall u erly destroy them the Hi te and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite just as the LORD your God has commanded you lest they teach you to do according to all their abomina ons which they have done for their gods and you sin against the LORD your God
When you besiege a city for a long me while making war against it to take it you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them if you can eat of them do not cut them down to use in the siege for the tree of the field is man s food

If anyone is found slain lying in the field in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance from the slain man to the surrounding ci es
And it shall be that the elders of the city nearest to the slain man will take a heifer which has not been worked and which has not pulled with a yoke
The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with flowing water which is neither plowed nor sown and they shall break the heifer s neck there in the valley
Then the priests the sons of Levi shall come near for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the LORD by their word every controversy and every assault shall be se led
And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley
Then they shall answer and say Our hands have not shed this blood nor have our eyes seen it
Provide atonement O LORD for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel
And atonement shall be provided on their behalf for the blood
So you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD
When you go out to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hand and you take them cap ve and you see among the cap ves a beau ful woman and desire her and would take her for your wife then you shall bring her home to your house and she shall shave her head and trim her nails

Therefore it shall be when you have crossed over the Jordan that on Mount Ebal you shall set up these stones which I command you today and you shall whitewash them with lime
And there you shall build an altar to the LORD your God an altar of stones you shall not use an iron tool on them
You shall build with whole stones the altar of the LORD your God and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God
You shall offer peace offerings and shall eat there and rejoice before the LORD your God
And you shall write very plainly on the stones all the words of this law
Then Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel saying Take heed and listen O Israel This day you have become the people of the LORD your God
Therefore you shall obey the voice of the LORD your God and observe His commandments and His statutes which I command you today
And Moses commanded the people on the same day saying These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have crossed over the Jordan Simeon Levi Judah Issachar Joseph and Benjamin and these shall stand on Mount Ebal to curse Reuben Gad Asher Zebulun Dan and Naphtali
And the Levites shall speak with a loud voice and say to all the men of Israel Cursed is the one who makes a carved or molded image an abomina on to the LORD the work of the hands of the cra sman and sets it up in secret
And all the people shall answer and say Amen Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt

And all the people shall say Amen Cursed is the one who lies with his mother in law
And all the people shall say Amen Cursed is the one who a acks his neighbor secretly
And all the people shall say Amen Cursed is the one who takes a bribe to slay an innocent person
And all the people shall say Amen Cursed is the one who does not confirm all the words of this law by observing them
And all the people shall say Amen Now it shall come to pass if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today that the LORD your God will set you high above all na ons of the earth
And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you because you obey the voice of the LORD your God Blessed shall you be in the city and blessed shall you be in the country
Blessed shall be the fruit of your body the produce of your ground and the increase of your herds the increase of your ca le and the offspring of your flocks

The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before your face they shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways
The LORD will command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you
The LORD will establish you as a holy people to Himself just as He has sworn to you if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways
Then all peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD and they shall be afraid of you
And the LORD will grant you plenty of goods in the fruit of your body in the increase of your livestock and in the produce of your ground in the land of which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you
The LORD will open to you His good treasure the heavens to give the rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hand
You shall lend to many na ons but you shall not borrow
And the LORD will make you the head and not the tail you shall be above only and not be beneath if you heed the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you today and are careful to observe them
So you shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day to the right or the le to go a er other gods to serve them
But it shall come to pass if you do not obey the voice of the LORD your God to observe carefully all His commandments and His statutes which I command you today that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you Cursed shall you be in the city and cursed shall you be in the country
Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl
Cursed shall be the fruit of your body and the produce of your land the increase of your ca le and the offspring of your flocks
Cursed shall you be when you come in and cursed shall you be when you go out
The LORD will send on you cursing confusion and rebuke in all that you set your hand to do un l you are destroyed and un l you perish quickly because of the wickedness of your doings in which you have forsaken Me
The LORD will make the plague cling to you un l He has consumed you from the land which you are going to possess

And your heavens which are over your head shall be bronze and the earth which is under you shall be iron

The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies you shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and you shall become troublesome to all the kingdoms of the earth
Your carcasses shall be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth and no one shall frighten them away
The LORD will strike you with the boils of Egypt with tumors with the scab and with the itch from which you cannot be healed
The LORD will strike you with madness and blindness and confusion of heart
And you shall grope at noonday as a blind man gropes in darkness you shall not prosper in your ways you shall be only oppressed and plundered con nually and no one shall save you
You shall betroth a wife but another man shall lie with her you shall build a house but you shall not dwell in it you shall plant a vineyard but shall not gather its grapes
Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes but you shall not eat of it your donkey shall be violently taken away from before you and shall not be restored to you your sheep shall be given to your enemies and you shall have no one to rescue them
Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people and your eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all day long and there shall be no strength in your hand
A na on whom you have not known shall eat the fruit of your land and the produce of your labor and you shall be only oppressed and crushed con nually
So you shall be driven mad because of the sight which your eyes see
The LORD will strike you in the knees and on the legs with severe boils which cannot be healed and from the sole of your foot to the top of your head
The LORD will bring you and the king whom you set over you to a na on which neither you nor your fathers have known and there you shall serve other gods wood and stone
And you shall become an astonishment a proverb and a byword among all na ons where the LORD will drive you
You shall carry much seed out to the field but gather li le in for the locust shall consume it

Locusts shall consume all your trees and the produce of your land
The alien who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you and you shall come down lower and lower
He shall lend to you but you shall not lend to him he shall be the head and you shall be the tail
Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you un l you are destroyed because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you
And they shall be upon you for a sign and a wonder and on your descendants forever
Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and gladness of heart for the abundance of everything therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you in hunger in thirst in nakedness and in need of everything and He will put a yoke of iron on your neck un l He has destroyed you
The LORD will bring a na on against you from afar from the end of the earth as swi as the eagle flies a na on whose language you will not understand a na on of fierce countenance which does not respect the elderly nor show favor to the young
And they shall eat the increase of your livestock and the produce of your land un l you are destroyed they shall not leave you grain or new wine or oil or the increase of your ca le or the offspring of your flocks un l they have destroyed you
They shall besiege you at all your gates un l your high and for fied walls in which you trust come down throughout all your land and they shall besiege you at all your gates throughout all your land which the LORD your God has given you
You shall eat the fruit of your own body the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom the LORD your God has given you in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you
The sensi ve and very refined man among you will be hos le toward his brother toward the wife of his bosom and toward the rest of his children whom he leaves behind so that he will not give any of them the flesh of his children whom he will eat because he has nothing le in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you at all your gates
The tender and delicate woman among you who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and sensi vity will refuse to the husband of her bosom and to her son and her daughter her placenta which comes out from between her feet and her children whom she bears for she will eat them secretly for lack of everything in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you at all your gates
If you do not carefully observe all the words of this law that are wri en in this book that you may fear this glorious and awesome name THE LORD YOUR GOD then the LORD will bring upon you and your descendants extraordinary plagues great and prolonged plagues and serious and prolonged sicknesses
Moreover He will bring back on you all the diseases of Egypt of which you were afraid and they shall cling to you
Also every sickness and every plague which is not wri en in this Book of the Law will the LORD bring upon you un l you are destroyed
You shall be le few in number whereas you were as the stars of heaven in mul tude because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God
And it shall be that just as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good and mul ply you so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to nothing and you shall be plucked from off the land which you go to possess
Then the LORD will sca er you among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other and there you shall serve other gods which neither you nor your fathers have known wood and stone
And among those na ons you shall find no rest nor shall the sole of your foot have a res ng place but there the LORD will give you a trembling heart failing eyes and anguish of soul
Your life shall hang in doubt before you you shall fear day and night and have no assurance of life
In the morning you shall say Oh that it were evening And at evening you shall say Oh that it were morning because of the fear which terrifies your heart and because of the sight which your eyes see
And the LORD will take you back to Egypt in ships by the way of which I said to you You shall never see it again
And there you shall be offered for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves but no one will buy you
These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab besides the covenant which He made with them in Horeb
Now Moses called all Israel and said to them You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land the great trials which your eyes have seen the signs and those great wonders
Yet the LORD has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear to this very day
And I have led you forty years in the wilderness
Your clothes have not worn out on you and your sandals have not worn out on your feet
You have not eaten bread nor have you drunk wine or similar drink that you may know that I am the LORD your God
And when you came to this place Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to ba le and we conquered them
We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh
Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them that you may prosper in all that you do
All of you stand today before the LORD your God your leaders and your tribes and your elders and your officers all the men of Israel your li le ones and your wives also the stranger who is in your camp from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water that you may enter into covenant with the LORD your God and into His oath which the LORD your God makes with you today that He may establish you today as a people for Himself and that He may be God to you just as He has spoken to you and just as He has sworn to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob
I make this covenant and this oath not with you alone but with him who stands here with us today before the LORD our God as well as with him who is not here with us today for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the na ons which you passed by and you saw their abomina ons and their idols which were among them wood and stone and silver and gold so that there may not be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God to go and serve the gods of these na ons and that there may not be among you a root bearing bi erness or wormwood and so it may not happen when he hears the words of this curse that he blesses himself in his heart saying I shall have peace even though I follow the dictates of my heart as though the drunkard could be included with the sober
The LORD would not spare him for then the anger of the LORD and His jealousy would burn against that man and every curse that is wri en in this book would se le on him and the LORD would blot out his name from under heaven
And the LORD would separate him from all the tribes of Israel for adversity according to all the curses of the covenant that are wri en in this Book of the Law so that the coming genera on of your children who rise up a er you and the foreigner who comes from a far land would say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid on it The whole land is brimstone salt and burning it is not sown nor does it bear nor does any grass grow there like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah Admah and Zeboim which the LORD overthrew in His anger and His wrath
All na ons would say Why has the LORD done so to this land What does the heat of this great anger mean Then people would say Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt for they went and served other gods and worshiped them gods that they did not know and that He had not given to them
Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against this land to bring on it every curse that is wri en in this book
And the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger in wrath and in great indigna on and cast them into another land as it is this day
The secret things belong to the LORD our God but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law
Now it shall come to pass when all these things come upon you the blessing and the curse which I have set before you and you call them to mind among all the na ons where the LORD your God drives you and you return to the LORD your God and obey His voice according to all that I command you today you and your children with all your heart and with all your soul that the LORD your God will bring you back from cap vity and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the na ons where the LORD your God has sca ered you
If any of you are driven out to the farthest parts under heaven from there the LORD your God will gather you and from there He will bring you
Then the LORD your God will bring you to the land which your fathers possessed and you shall possess it
He will prosper you and mul ply you more than your fathers
And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul that you may live
Also the LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you who persecuted you
And you will again obey the voice of the LORD and do all His commandments which I command you today
The LORD your God will make you abound in all the work of your hand in the fruit of your body in the increase of your livestock and in the produce of your land for good
For the LORD will again rejoice over you for good as He rejoiced over your fathers if you obey the voice of the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are wri en in this Book of the Law and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul
For this commandment which I command you today is not too mysterious for you nor is it far off
It is not in heaven that you should say Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it Nor is it beyond the sea that you should say Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it But the word is very near you in your mouth and in your heart that you may do it
See I have set before you today life and good death and evil in that I command you today to love the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments His statutes and His judgments that you may live and mul ply and the LORD your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess
But if your heart turns away so that you do not hear and are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them I announce to you today that you shall surely perish you shall not prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess
I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both you and your descendants may live that you may love the LORD your God that you may obey His voice and that you may cling to Him for He is your life and the length of your days and that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give them
Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel
And he said to them I am one hundred and twenty years old today
I can no longer go out and come in
Also the LORD has said to me You shall not cross over this Jordan
The LORD your God Himself crosses over before you He will destroy these na ons from before you and you shall dispossess them
Joshua himself crosses over before you just as the LORD has said
And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og the kings of the Amorites and their land when He destroyed them
The LORD will give them over to you that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you
Be strong and of good courage do not fear nor be afraid of them for the LORD your God He is the One who goes with you
He will not leave you nor forsake you
Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel Be strong and of good courage for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them and you shall cause them to inherit it
And the LORD He is the one who goes before you
He will be with you He will not leave you nor forsake you do not fear nor be dismayed
So Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD and to all the elders of Israel
And Moses commanded them saying At the end of every seven years at the appointed me in the year of release at the Feast of Tabernacles when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing
Gather the people together men and women and li le ones and the stranger who is within your gates that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the LORD your God and carefully observe all the words of this law and that their children who have not known it may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess
Then the LORD said to Moses Behold the days approach when you must die call Joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of mee ng that I may inaugurate him
So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of mee ng
Now the LORD appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle
And the LORD said to Moses Behold you will rest with your fathers and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land where they go to be among them and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them
Then My anger shall be aroused against them in that day and I will forsake them and I will hide My face from them and they shall be devoured
And many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us And I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done in that they have turned to other gods
Now therefore write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the children of Israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel
When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey of which I swore to their fathers and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat then they will turn to other gods and serve them and they will provoke Me and break My covenant
Then it shall be when many evils and troubles have come upon them that this song will tes fy against them as a witness for it will not be forgo en in the mouths of their descendants for I know the inclina on of their behavior today even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore to give them
Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the children of Israel
Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun and said Be strong and of good courage for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them and I will be with you
So it was when Moses had completed wri ng the words of this law in a book when they were finished that Moses commanded the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD saying Take this Book of the Law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God that it may be there as a witness against you for I know your rebellion and your s ff neck
If today while I am yet alive with you you have been rebellious against the LORD then how much more a er my death Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them
For I know that a er my death you will become u erly corrupt and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will befall you in the la er days because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands
Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song un l they were ended Give ear O heavens and I will speak And hear O earth the words of my mouth
Let my teaching drop as the rain My speech dis ll as the dew As raindrops on the tender herb And as showers on the grass
For I proclaim the name of the LORD Ascribe greatness to our God
He is the Rock His work is perfect For all His ways are jus ce A God of truth and without injus ce Righteous and upright is He
They have corrupted themselves They are not His children Because of their blemish A perverse and crooked genera on
Do you thus deal with the LORD O foolish and unwise people Is He not your Father who bought you Has He not made you and established you Remember the days of old Consider the years of many genera ons
Ask your father and he will show you Your elders and they will tell you When the Most High divided their inheritance to the na ons When He separated the sons of Adam He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel
For the LORD S por on is His people Jacob is the place of His inheritance
He found him in a desert land And in the wasteland a howling wilderness He encircled him He instructed him He kept him as the apple of His eye
As an eagle s rs up its nest Hovers over its young Spreading out its wings taking them up Carrying them on its wings So the LORD alone led him And there was no foreign god with him
He made him ride in the heights of the earth That he might eat the produce of the fields He made him draw honey from the rock And oil from the flinty rock Curds from the ca le and milk of the flock With fat of lambs And rams of the breed of Bashan and goats With the choicest wheat And you drank wine the blood of the grapes
But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked You grew fat you grew thick You are obese Then he forsook God who made him And scornfully esteemed the Rock of his salva on
They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods With abomina ons they provoked Him to anger
They sacrificed to demons not to God To gods they did not know To new gods new arrivals That your fathers did not fear
Of the Rock who begot you you are unmindful And have forgo en the God who fathered you
And when the LORD saw it He spurned them Because of the provoca on of His sons and His daughters
And He said I will hide My face from them I will see what their end will be For they are a perverse genera on Children in whom is no faith
They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not God They have moved Me to anger by their foolish idols
But I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a na on I will move them to anger by a foolish na on
For a fire is kindled by my anger And shall burn to the lowest hell It shall consume the earth with her increase And set on fire the founda ons of the mountains
I will heap disasters on them I will spend My arrows on them
They shall be wasted with hunger Devoured by pes lence and bi er destruc on I will also send against them the teeth of beasts With the poison of serpents of the dust
The sword shall destroy outside There shall be terror within For the young man and virgin The nursing child with the man of gray hairs
I would have said I will dash them in pieces I will make the memory of them to cease from among men Had I not feared the wrath of the enemy Lest their adversaries should misunderstand Lest they should say Our hand is high And it is not the LORD who has done all this
For they are a na on void of counsel Nor is there any understanding in them
Oh that they were wise that they understood this That they would consider their la er end How could one chase a thousand And two put ten thousand to flight Unless their Rock had sold them And the LORD had surrendered them For their rock is not like our Rock Even our enemies themselves being judges
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom And of the fields of Gomorrah Their grapes are grapes of gall Their clusters are bi er
Their wine is the poison of serpents And the cruel venom of cobras
Is this not laid up in store with Me Sealed up among My treasures Vengeance is Mine and recompense Their foot shall slip in due me For the day of their calamity is at hand And the things to come hasten upon them
For the LORD will judge His people And have compassion on His servants When He sees that their power is gone And there is no one remaining bond or free
He will say Where are their gods The rock in which they sought refuge Who ate the fat of their sacrifices And drank the wine of their drink offering Let them rise and help you And be your refuge
Now see that I even I am He And there is no God besides Me I kill and I make alive I wound and I heal Nor is there any who can deliver from My hand
For I raise My hand to heaven And say As I live forever If I whet My gli ering sword And My hand takes hold on judgment I will render vengeance to My enemies And repay those who hate Me
I will make My arrows drunk with blood And My sword shall devour flesh With the blood of the slain and the cap ves From the heads of the leaders of the enemy
Rejoice O Gen les with His people For He will avenge the blood of His servants And render vengeance to His adversaries He will provide atonement for His land and His people
So Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people
Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel and He said to them Set your hearts on all the words which I tes fy among you today which you shall command your children to be careful to observe all the words of this law
For it is not a fu le thing for you because it is your life and by this word you shall prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess
Then the LORD spoke to Moses that very same day saying Go up this mountain of the Abarim Mount Nebo which is in the land of Moab across from Jericho view the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel as a possession and die on the mountain which you ascend and be gathered to your people just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people because you trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin because you did not hallow Me in the midst of the children of Israel
Yet you shall see the land before you though you shall not go there into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel
Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death
And he said The LORD came from Sinai And dawned on them from Seir He shone forth from Mount Paran And He came with ten thousands of saints From His right hand Came a fiery law for them
Yes He loves the people All His saints are in Your hand They sit down at Your feet Everyone receives Your words
Moses commanded a law for us A heritage of the congrega on of Jacob
And He was King in Jeshurun When the leaders of the people were gathered All the tribes of Israel together
Let Reuben live and not die Nor let his men be few
And this he said of Judah Hear LORD the voice of Judah And bring him to his people Let his hands be sufficient for him And may You be a help against his enemies
And of Levi he said Let Your Thummim and Your Urim be with Your holy one Whom You tested at Massah And with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah Who says of his father and mother I have not seen them Nor did he acknowledge his brothers Or know his own children For they have observed Your word And kept Your covenant
They shall teach Jacob Your judgments And Israel Your law
They shall put incense before You And a whole burnt sacrifice on Your altar
Bless his substance LORD And accept the work of his hands Strike the loins of those who rise against him And of those who hate him that they rise not again
Of Benjamin he said The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him Who shelters him all the day long And he shall dwell between His shoulders
And of Joseph he said Blessed of the LORD is his land With the precious things of heaven with the dew And the deep lying beneath With the precious fruits of the sun With the precious produce of the months With the best things of the ancient mountains With the precious things of the everlas ng hills With the precious things of the earth and its fullness And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush
Let the blessing come on the head of Joseph And on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers
His glory is like a firstborn bull And his horns like the horns of the wild ox Together with them He shall push the peoples To the ends of the earth They are the ten thousands of Ephraim And they are the thousands of Manasseh
And of Zebulun he said Rejoice Zebulun in your going out And Issachar in your tents They shall call the peoples to the mountain There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness For they shall partake of the abundance of the seas And of treasures hidden in the sand
And of Gad he said Blessed is he who enlarges Gad He dwells as a lion And tears the arm and the crown of his head
He provided the first part for himself Because a lawgiver s por on was reserved there
He came with the heads of the people He administered the jus ce of the LORD And His judgments with Israel
And of Dan he said Dan is a lion s whelp He shall leap from Bashan
And of Naphtali he said O Naphtali sa sfied with favor And full of the blessing of the LORD Possess the west and the south
And of Asher he said Asher is most blessed of sons Let him be favored by his brothers And let him dip his foot in oil
Your sandals shall be iron and bronze As your days so shall your strength be
There is no one like the God of Jeshurun Who rides the heavens to help you And in His excellency on the clouds
The eternal God is your refuge And underneath are the everlas ng arms He will thrust out the enemy from before you And will say Destroy Then Israel shall dwell in safety The fountain of Jacob alone In a land of grain and new wine His heavens shall also drop dew
Happy are you O Israel Who is like you a people saved by the LORD The shield of your help And the sword of your majesty Your enemies shall submit to you And you shall tread down their high places
Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah which is across from Jericho
And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea the South and the plain of the Valley of Jericho the city of palm trees as far as Zoar
Then the LORD said to him This is the land of which I swore to give Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying I will give it to your descendants
I have caused you to see it with your eyes but you shall not cross over there
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab according to the word of the LORD
And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor but no one knows his grave to this day
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died
His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days
So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended
Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands on him so the children of Israel heeded him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses
But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses whom the LORD knew face to face in all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt before Pharaoh before all his servants and in all his land and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel
Joshua A er the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun Moses assistant saying Moses My servant is dead
Now therefore arise go over this Jordan you and all this people to the land which I am giving to them the children of Israel
Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you as I said to Moses
From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river the River Euphrates all the land of the Hi tes and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory
No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life as I was with Moses so I will be with you
I will not leave you nor forsake you
Be strong and of good courage for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them
Only be strong and very courageous that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you do not turn from it to the right hand or to the le that you may prosper wherever you go
This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is wri en in it
For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success
Have I not commanded you Be strong and of good courage do not be afraid nor be dismayed for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying Pass through the camp and command the people saying Prepare provisions for yourselves for within three days you will cross over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess
And to the Reubenites the Gadites and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke saying Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you saying The LORD your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land
Your wives your li le ones and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan
But you shall pass before your brethren armed all your mighty men of valor and help them un l the LORD has given your brethren rest as He gave you and they also have taken possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving them
Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it which Moses the LORD S servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise
So they answered Joshua saying All that you command us we will do and wherever you send us we will go
Just as we heeded Moses in all things so we will heed you
Only the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses
Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words in all that you command him shall be put to death
Only be strong and of good courage
Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Acacia Grove to spy secretly saying Go view the land especially Jericho
So they went and came to the house of a harlot named Rahab and lodged there
And it was told the king of Jericho saying Behold men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country
So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying Bring out the men who have come to you who have entered your house for they have come to search out all the country
Then the woman took the two men and hid them
So she said Yes the men came to me but I did not know where they were from
And it happened as the gate was being shut when it was dark that the men went out
Where the men went I do not know pursue them quickly for you may overtake them
But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof
Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan to the fords
And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out they shut the gate
Now before they lay down she came up to them on the roof and said to the men I know that the LORD has given you the land that the terror of you has fallen on us and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you
For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan Sihon and Og whom you u erly destroyed
And as soon as we heard these things our hearts melted neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you for the LORD your God He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath
Now therefore I beg you swear to me by the LORD since I have shown you kindness that you also will show kindness to my father s house and give me a true token and spare my father my mother my brothers my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death
So the men answered her Our lives for yours if none of you tell this business of ours
And it shall be when the LORD has given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with you
Then she let them down by a rope through the window for her house was on the city wall she dwelt on the wall
And she said to them Get to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you
Hide there three days un l the pursuers have returned
A erward you may go your way
So the men said to her We will be blameless of this oath of yours which you have made us swear unless when we come into the land you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down and unless you bring your father your mother your brothers and all your father s household to your own home
So it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street his blood shall be on his own head and we will be guiltless
And whoever is with you in the house his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him
And if you tell this business of ours then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear
Then she said According to your words so be it
And she sent them away and they departed
And she bound the scarlet cord in the window
They departed and went to the mountain and stayed there three days un l the pursuers returned
The pursuers sought them all along the way but did not find them
So the two men returned descended from the mountain and crossed over and they came to Joshua the son of Nun and told him all that had befallen them
And they said to Joshua Truly the LORD has delivered all the land into our hands for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us
Then Joshua rose early in the morning and they set out from Acacia Grove and came to the Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they crossed over
So it was a er three days that the officers went through the camp and they commanded the people saying When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then you shall set out from your place and go a er it
Yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure
Do not come near it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way before
And Joshua said to the people Sanc fy yourselves for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you
Then Joshua spoke to the priests saying Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people
So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people
And the LORD said to Joshua This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with you
You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant saying When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan you shall stand in the Jordan
So Joshua said to the children of Israel Come here and hear the words of the LORD your God
And Joshua said By this you shall know that the living God is among you and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hi tes and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan
Now therefore take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel one man from every tribe
And it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of the Jordan that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off the waters that come down from upstream and they shall stand as a heap
So it was when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole me of harvest that the waters which came down from upstream stood s ll and rose in a heap very far away at Adam the city that is beside Zaretan
So the waters that went down into the Sea of the Arabah the Salt Sea failed and were cut off and the people crossed over opposite Jericho
Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan and all Israel crossed over on dry ground un l all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan
And it came to pass when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan that the LORD spoke to Joshua saying Take for yourselves twelve men from the people one man from every tribe and command them saying Take for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan from the place where the priests feet stood firm
You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight
Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel one man from every tribe and Joshua said to them Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in me to come saying What do these stones mean to you Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD when it crossed over the Jordan the waters of the Jordan were cut off
And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever
And the children of Israel did so just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan as the LORD had spoken to Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there
Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood and they are there to this day
So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan un l everything was finished that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua and the people hurried and crossed over
Then it came to pass when all the people had completely crossed over that the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people
And the men of Reuben the men of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel as Moses had spoken to them
About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before the LORD for ba le to the plains of Jericho
On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel and they feared him as they had feared Moses all the days of his life
Then the LORD spoke to Joshua saying Command the priests who bear the ark of the Tes mony to come up from the Jordan
Joshua therefore commanded the priests saying Come up from the Jordan
And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come from the midst of the Jordan and the soles of the priests feet touched the dry land that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before
Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho
And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan Joshua set up in Gilgal
Then he spoke to the children of Israel saying When your children ask their fathers in me to come saying What are these stones then you shall let your children know saying Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land for the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you un l you had crossed over as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up before us un l we had crossed over that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the LORD that it is mighty that you may fear the LORD your God forever
So it was when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel un l we had crossed over that their heart melted and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel
At that me the LORD said to Joshua Make flint knives for yourself and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second me
So Joshua made flint knives for himself and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins
And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them All the people who came out of Egypt who were males all the men of war had died in the wilderness on the way a er they had come out of Egypt
For all the people who came out had been circumcised but all the people born in the wilderness on the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised
For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness ll all the people who were men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed because they did not obey the voice of the LORD to whom the LORD swore that He would not show them the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers that He would give us a land flowing with milk and honey
Then Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way
So it was when they had finished circumcising all the people that they stayed in their places in the camp ll they were healed
Then the LORD said to Joshua This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you
Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day
Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho
And they ate of the produce of the land on the day a er the Passover unleavened bread and parched grain on the very same day
Then the manna ceased on the day a er they had eaten the produce of the land and the children of Israel no longer had manna but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year
And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he li ed his eyes and looked and behold a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand
And Joshua went to Him and said to Him Are You for us or for our adversaries So He said No but as Commander of the army of the LORD I have now come
And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to Him What does my Lord say to His servant Then the Commander of the LORD S army said to Joshua Take your sandal off your foot for the place where you stand is holy
And Joshua did so
Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in
And the LORD said to Joshua See I have given Jericho into your hand its king and the mighty men of valor
You shall march around the city all you men of war you shall go all around the city once
This you shall do six days
And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark
But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven mes and the priests shall blow the trumpets
It shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the ram s horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet that all the people shall shout with a great shout then the wall of the city will fall down flat
And the people shall go up every man straight before him
Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the LORD
And he said to the people Proceed and march around the city and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the LORD
So it was when Joshua had spoken to the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns before the LORD advanced and blew the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them
The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets and the rear guard came a er the ark while the priests con nued blowing the trumpets
Now Joshua had commanded the people saying You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth un l the day I say to you Shout Then you shall shout
So he had the ark of the LORD circle the city going around it once
Then they came into the camp and lodged in the camp
And Joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD
Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the LORD went on con nually and blew with the trumpets
And the armed men went before them
But the rear guard came a er the ark of the LORD while the priests con nued blowing the trumpets
And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp
So they did six days
But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and marched around the city seven mes in the same manner
On that day only they marched around the city seven mes
And the seventh me it happened when the priests blew the trumpets that Joshua said to the people Shout for the LORD has given you the city Now the city shall be doomed by the LORD to destruc on it and all who are in it
Only Rahab the harlot shall live she and all who are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent
And you by all means abstain from the accursed things lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it
But all the silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron are consecrated to the LORD they shall come into the treasury of the LORD
So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets
And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat
Then the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city
And they u erly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old ox and sheep and donkey with the edge of the sword
But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country Go into the harlot s house and from there bring out the woman and all that she has as you swore to her
And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab her father her mother her brothers and all that she had
So they brought out all her rela ves and le them outside the camp of Israel
But they burned the city and all that was in it with fire
Only the silver and gold and the vessels of bronze and iron they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD
And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot her father s household and all that she had
So she dwells in Israel to this day because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho
Then Joshua charged them at that me saying Cursed be the man before the LORD who rises up and builds this city Jericho he shall lay its founda on with his firstborn and with his youngest he shall set up its gates
So the LORD was with Joshua and his fame spread throughout all the country
But the children of Israel commi ed a trespass regarding the accursed things for Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed things so the anger of the LORD burned against the children of Israel
Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is beside Beth Aven on the east side of Bethel and spoke to them saying Go up and spy out the country
So the men went up and spied out Ai
And they returned to Joshua and said to him Do not let all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and a ack Ai
Do not weary all the people there for the people of Ai are few
So about three thousand men went up there from the people but they fled before the men of Ai
And the men of Ai struck down about thirty six men for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent therefore the hearts of the people melted and became like water
Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD un l evening he and the elders of Israel and they put dust on their heads
And Joshua said Alas Lord GOD why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us Oh that we had been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan O Lord what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it and surround us and cut off our name from the earth
Then what will You do for Your great name So the LORD said to Joshua Get up Why do you lie thus on your face Israel has sinned and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them
For they have even taken some of the accursed things and have both stolen and deceived and they have also put it among their own stuff
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they have become doomed to destruc on
Neither will I be with you anymore unless you destroy the accursed from among you
Get up sanc fy the people and say Sanc fy yourselves for tomorrow because thus says the LORD God of Israel There is an accursed thing in your midst O Israel you cannot stand before your enemies un l you take away the accursed thing from among you
In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes
And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to families and the family which the LORD takes shall come by households and the household which the LORD takes shall come man by man
Then it shall be that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire he and all that he has because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel
So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes and the tribe of Judah was taken
He brought the clan of Judah and he took the family of the Zarhites and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man and Zabdi was taken
Then he brought his household man by man and Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken
Now Joshua said to Achan My son I beg you give glory to the LORD God of Israel and make confession to Him and tell me now what you have done do not hide it from me
And Achan answered Joshua and said Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel and this is what I have done When I saw among the spoils a beau ful Babylonian garment two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fi y shekels I coveted them and took them
And there they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent with the silver under it
So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and there it was hidden in his tent with the silver under it
And they took them from the midst of the tent brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel and laid them out before the LORD
Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah the silver the garment the wedge of gold his sons his daughters his oxen his donkeys his sheep his tent and all that he had and they brought them to the Valley of Achor
And Joshua said Why have you troubled us The LORD will trouble you this day
So all Israel stoned him with stones and they burned them with fire a er they had stoned them with stones
Then they raised over him a great heap of stones s ll there to this day
So the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger
Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day
Now the LORD said to Joshua Do not be afraid nor be dismayed take all the people of war with you and arise go up to Ai
See I have given into your hand the king of Ai his people his city and his land
And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king
Only its spoil and its ca le you shall take as booty for yourselves
Lay an ambush for the city behind it
So Joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against Ai and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night
And he commanded them saying Behold you shall lie in ambush against the city behind the city
Do not go very far from the city but all of you be ready
Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city and it will come about when they come out against us as at the first that we shall flee before them
For they will come out a er us ll we have drawn them from the city for they will say They are fleeing before us as at the first
Therefore we will flee before them
Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand
And it will be when you have taken the city that you shall set the city on fire
According to the commandment of the LORD you shall do
See I have commanded you
Joshua therefore sent them out and they went to lie in ambush and stayed between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai but Joshua lodged that night among the people
Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people and went up he and the elders of Israel before the people to Ai
And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai
Now a valley lay between them and Ai
So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai on the west side of the city
And when they had set the people all the army that was on the north of the city and its rear guard on the west of the city Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley
Now it happened when the king of Ai saw it that the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out against Israel to ba le he and all his people at an appointed place before the plain
But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city
And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness
So all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue them
And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city
There was not a man le in Ai or Bethel who did not go out a er Israel
So they le the city open and pursued Israel
Then the LORD said to Joshua Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai for I will give it into your hand
And Joshua stretched out the spear that was in his hand toward the city
So those in ambush arose quickly out of their place they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered the city and took it and hurried to set the city on fire
And when the men of Ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended to heaven
So they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers
Now when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended they turned back and struck down the men of Ai
Then the others came out of the city against them so they were caught in the midst of Israel some on this side and some on that side
And they struck them down so that they let none of them remain or escape
But the king of Ai they took alive and brought him to Joshua
And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword un l they were consumed that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword
So it was that all who fell that day both men and women were twelve thousand all the people of Ai
For Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the spear un l he had u erly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai
Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua
So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever a desola on to this day
And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree un l evening
And as soon as the sun was down Joshua commanded that they should take his corpse down from the tree cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day
Now Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in Mount Ebal as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the children of Israel as it is wri en in the Book of the Law of Moses an altar of whole stones over which no man has wielded an iron tool
And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings
And there in the presence of the children of Israel he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he had wri en
Then all Israel with their elders and officers and judges stood on either side of the ark before the priests the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD the stranger as well as he who was born among them
Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before that they should bless the people of Israel
And a erward he read all the words of the law the blessings and the cursings according to all that is wri en in the Book of the Law
There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women the li le ones and the strangers who were living among them
And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side of the Jordan in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon the Hi te the Amorite the Canaanite the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite heard about it that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one accord
But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai they worked cra ily and went and pretended to be ambassadors
And they took old sacks on their donkeys old wineskins torn and mended old and patched sandals on their feet and old garments on themselves and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy
And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel We have come from a far country now therefore make a covenant with us
Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites Perhaps you dwell among us so how can we make a covenant with you But they said to Joshua We are your servants
And Joshua said to them Who are you and where do you come from So they said to him From a very far country your servants have come because of the name of the LORD your God for we have heard of His fame and all that He did in Egypt and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth
Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us saying Take provisions with you for the journey and go to meet them and say to them We are your servants now therefore make a covenant with us
This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you
But now look it is dry and moldy
And these wineskins which we filled were new and see they are torn and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey
Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions but they did not ask counsel of the LORD
So Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live and the rulers of the congrega on swore to them
And it happened at the end of three days a er they had made a covenant with them that they heard that they were their neighbors who dwelt near them
Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their ci es on the third day
Now their ci es were Gibeon Chephirah Beeroth and Kirjath Jearim
But the children of Israel did not a ack them because the rulers of the congrega on had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel
And all the congrega on complained against the rulers
Then all the rulers said to all the congrega on We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel now therefore we may not touch them
This we will do to them We will let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them
And the rulers said to them Let them live but let them be woodcu ers and water carriers for all the congrega on as the rulers had promised them
Then Joshua called for them and he spoke to them saying Why have you deceived us saying We are very far from you when you dwell near us Now therefore you are cursed and none of you shall be freed from being slaves woodcu ers and water carriers for the house of my God
So they answered Joshua and said Because your servants were clearly told that the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you and have done this thing
And now here we are in your hands do with us as it seems good and right to do to us
So he did to them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel so that they did not kill them
And that day Joshua made them woodcu ers and water carriers for the congrega on and for the altar of the LORD in the place which He would choose even to this day
Now it came to pass when Adoni Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had u erly destroyed it as he had done to Jericho and its king so he had done to Ai and its king and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them that they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great city like one of the royal ci es and because it was greater than Ai and all its men were mighty
Therefore Adoni Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron Piram king of Jarmuth Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon saying Come up to me and help me that we may a ack Gibeon for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon gathered together and went up they and all their armies and camped before Gibeon and made war against it
And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal saying Do not forsake your servants come up to us quickly save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor
And the LORD said to Joshua Do not fear them for I have delivered them into your hand not a man of them shall stand before you
Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly having marched all night from Gilgal
So the LORD routed them before Israel killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon chased them along the road that goes to Beth Horon and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah
And it happened as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon that the LORD cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah and they died
There were more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword
Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel Sun stand s ll over Gibeon And Moon in the Valley of Aijalon
So the sun stood s ll And the moon stopped Till the people had revenge Upon their enemies
Is this not wri en in the Book of Jasher So the sun stood s ll in the midst of heaven and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day
And there has been no day like that before it or a er it that the LORD heeded the voice of a man for the LORD fought for Israel
Then Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal
But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah
And it was told Joshua saying The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah
So Joshua said Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them
And do not stay there yourselves but pursue your enemies and a ack their rear guard
Do not allow them to enter their ci es for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand
Then it happened while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter ll they had finished that those who escaped entered for fied ci es
And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace
No one moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel
Then Joshua said Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings to me from the cave
And they did so and brought out those five kings to him from the cave the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon
So it was when they brought out those kings to Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him Come near put your feet on the necks of these kings
And they drew near and put their feet on their necks
Then Joshua said to them Do not be afraid nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight
And a erward Joshua struck them and killed them and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging on the trees un l evening
So it was at the me of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded and they took them down from the trees cast them into the cave where they had been hidden and laid large stones against the cave s mouth which remain un l this very day
On that day Joshua took Makkedah and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword
He u erly destroyed them all the people who were in it
He let none remain
He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho
Then Joshua passed from Makkedah and all Israel with him to Libnah and they fought against Libnah
And the LORD also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel he struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword
He let none remain in it but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho
Then Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him to Lachish and they encamped against it and fought against it
And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel who took it on the second day and struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword according to all that he had done to Libnah
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish and Joshua struck him and his people un l he le him none remaining
From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon and all Israel with him and they encamped against it and fought against it
They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword all the people who were in it he u erly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to Lachish
So Joshua went up from Eglon and all Israel with him to Hebron and they fought against it
And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword its king all its ci es and all the people who were in it he le none remaining according to all that he had done to Eglon but u erly destroyed it and all the people who were in it
Then Joshua returned and all Israel with him to Debir and they fought against it
And he took it and its king and all its ci es they struck them with the edge of the sword and u erly destroyed all the people who were in it
He le none remaining as he had done to Hebron so he did to Debir and its king as he had done also to Libnah and its king
So Joshua conquered all the land the mountain country and the South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes and all their kings he le none remaining but u erly destroyed all that breathed as the LORD God of Israel had commanded
And Joshua conquered them from Kadesh Barnea as far as Gaza and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon
All these kings and their land Joshua took at one me because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel
Then Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal
And it came to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heard these things that he sent to Jobab king of Madon to the king of Shimron to the king of Achshaph and to the kings who were from the north in the mountains in the plain south of Chinneroth in the lowland and in the heights of Dor on the west to the Canaanites in the east and in the west the Amorite the Hi te the Perizzite the Jebusite in the mountains and the Hivite below Hermon in the land of Mizpah
So they went out they and all their armies with them as many people as the sand that is on the seashore in mul tude with very many horses and chariots
And when all these kings had met together they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel
But the LORD said to Joshua Do not be afraid because of them for tomorrow about this me I will deliver all of them slain before Israel
You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire
So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom and they a acked them
And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel who defeated them and chased them to Greater Sidon to the Brook Misrephoth and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward they a acked them un l they le none of them remaining
So Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire
Joshua turned back at that me and took Hazor and struck its king with the sword for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms
And they struck all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword u erly destroying them
There was none le breathing
Then he burned Hazor with fire
So all the ci es of those kings and all their kings Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword
He u erly destroyed them as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded
But as for the ci es that stood on their mounds Israel burned none of them except Hazor only which Joshua burned
And all the spoil of these ci es and the livestock the children of Israel took as booty for themselves but they struck every man with the edge of the sword un l they had destroyed them and they le none breathing
As the LORD had commanded Moses his servant so Moses commanded Joshua and so Joshua did
He le nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses
Thus Joshua took all this land the mountain country all the South all the land of Goshen the lowland and the Jordan plain the mountains of Israel and its lowlands from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon
He captured all their kings and struck them down and killed them
Joshua made war a long me with all those kings
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon
All the others they took in ba le
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in ba le that He might u erly destroy them and that they might receive no mercy but that He might destroy them as the LORD had commanded Moses
And at that me Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains from Hebron from Debir from Anab from all the mountains of Judah and from all the mountains of Israel Joshua u erly destroyed them with their ci es
None of the Anakim were le in the land of the children of Israel they remained only in Gaza in Gath and in Ashdod
So Joshua took the whole land according to all that the LORD had said to Moses and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes
Then the land rested from war
These are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel defeated and whose land they possessed on the other side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon and all the eastern Jordan plain One king was Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled half of Gilead from Aroer which is on the bank of the River Arnon from the middle of that river even as far as the River Jabbok which is the border of the Ammonites and the eastern Jordan plain from the Sea of Chinneroth as far as the Sea of the Arabah the Salt Sea the road to Beth Jeshimoth and southward below the slopes of Pisgah
The other king was Og king of Bashan and his territory who was of the remnant of the giants who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei and reigned over Mount Hermon over Salcah over all Bashan as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites and over half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon
These Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel had conquered and Moses the servant of the LORD had given it as a possession to the Reubenites the Gadites and half the tribe of Manasseh
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel conquered on this side of the Jordan on the west from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon as far as Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions in the mountain country in the lowlands in the Jordan plain in the slopes in the wilderness and in the South the Hi tes the Amorites the Canaanites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites the king of Jericho one the king of Ai which is beside Bethel one the king of Jerusalem one the king of Hebron one the king of Jarmuth one the king of Lachish one the king of Eglon one the king of Gezer one the king of Debir one the king of Geder one the king of Hormah one the king of Arad one the king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one the king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one the king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one the king of Aphek one the king of Lasharon one the king of Madon one the king of Hazor one the king of Shimron Meron one the king of Achshaph one the king of Taanach one the king of Megiddo one the king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one the king of Dor in the heights of Dor one the king of the people of Gilgal one the king of Tirzah one all the kings thirty one
Now Joshua was old advanced in years
And the LORD said to him You are old advanced in years and there remains very much land yet to be possessed
This is the land that yet remains all the territory of the Philis nes and all that of the Geshurites from Sihor which is east of Egypt as far as the border of Ekron northward which is counted as Canaanite the five lords of the Philis nes the Gazites the Ashdodites the Ashkelonites the Gi tes and the Ekronites also the Avites from the south all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians as far as Aphek to the border of the Amorites the land of the Gebalites and all Lebanon toward the sunrise from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath all the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon as far as the Brook Misrephoth and all the Sidonians them I will drive out from before the children of Israel only divide it by lot to Israel as an inheritance as I have commanded you
Now therefore divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh
With the other half tribe the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses had given them beyond the Jordan eastward as Moses the servant of the LORD had given them from Aroer which is on the bank of the River Arnon and the town that is in the midst of the ravine and all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon all the ci es of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon as far as the border of the children of Ammon Gilead and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites all Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salcah all the kingdom of Og in Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for Moses had defeated and cast out these
Nevertheless the children of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maachathites but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites un l this day
Only to the tribe of Levi he had given no inheritance the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance as He said to them
And Moses had given to the tribe of the children of Reuben an inheritance according to their families
Their territory was from Aroer which is on the bank of the River Arnon and the city that is in the midst of the ravine and all the plain by Medeba Heshbon and all its ci es that are in the plain Dibon Bamoth Baal Beth Baal Meon Jahaza Kedemoth Mephaath Kirjathaim Sibmah Zereth Shahar on the mountain of the valley Beth Peor the slopes of Pisgah and Beth Jeshimoth all the ci es of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon whom Moses had struck with the princes of Midian Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Reba who were princes of Sihon dwelling in the country
The children of Israel also killed with the sword Balaam the son of Beor the soothsayer among those who were killed by them
And the border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan
This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families the ci es and their villages
Moses also had given an inheritance to the tribe of Gad to the children of Gad according to their families
Their territory was Jazer and all the ci es of Gilead and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir and in the valley Beth Haram Beth Nimrah Succoth and Zaphon the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon with the Jordan as its border as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families the ci es and their villages
Moses also had given an inheritance to half the tribe of Manasseh it was for half the tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families Their territory was from Mahanaim all Bashan all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan sixty ci es half of Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei ci es of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh for half of the children of Machir according to their families
These are the areas which Moses had distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan by Jericho eastward
But to the tribe of Levi Moses had given no inheritance the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance as He had said to them
These are the areas which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed as an inheritance to them
Their inheritance was by lot as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine tribes and the half tribe
For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe on the other side of the Jordan but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them
For the children of Joseph were two tribes Manasseh and Ephraim
And they gave no part to the Levites in the land except ci es to dwell in with their common lands for their livestock and their property
As the LORD had commanded Moses so the children of Israel did and they divided the land
Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal
And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him You know the word which the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart
Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the LORD my God
So Moses swore on that day saying Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children s forever because you have wholly followed the LORD my God
And now behold the LORD has kept me alive as He said these forty five years ever since the LORD spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness and now here I am this day eighty five years old
As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me just as my strength was then so now is my strength for war both for going out and for coming in
Now therefore give me this mountain of which the LORD spoke in that day for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there and that the ci es were great and for fied
It may be that the LORD will be with me and I shall be able to drive them out as the LORD said
And Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel
And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim
Then the land had rest from war
So this was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families The border of Edom at the Wilderness of Zin southward was the extreme southern boundary
And their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea from the bay that faces southward
Then it went out to the southern side of the Ascent of Akrabbim passed along to Zin ascended on the south side of Kadesh Barnea passed along to Hezron went up to Adar and went around to Karkaa
From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the Brook of Egypt and the border ended at the sea
This shall be your southern border
The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan
And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan
The border went up to Beth Hoglah and passed north of Beth Arabah and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben
Then the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor and it turned northward toward Gilgal which is before the Ascent of Adummim which is on the south side of the valley
The border con nued toward the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel
And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusite city which is Jerusalem
The border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward which is at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward
Then the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah and extended to the ci es of Mount Ephron
And the border went around to Baalah which is Kirjath Jearim
Then the border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north which is Chesalon went down to Beth Shemesh and passed on to Timnah
And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward
Then the border went around to Shicron passed along to Mount Baalah and extended to Jabneel and the border ended at the sea
The west border was the coastline of the Great Sea
This is the boundary of the children of Judah all around according to their families
Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a share among the children of Judah according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua namely Kirjath Arba which is Hebron Arba was the father of Anak
Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from there Sheshai Ahiman and Talmai the children of Anak
Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher
And Caleb said He who a acks Kirjath Sepher and takes it to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife
So Othniel the son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb took it and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife
Now it was so when she came to him that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field
So she dismounted from her donkey and Caleb said to her What do you wish She answered Give me a blessing since you have given me land in the South give me also springs of water
So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families The ci es at the limits of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel Eder Jagur Kinah Dimonah Adadah Kedesh Hazor Ithnan Ziph Telem Bealoth Hazor Hada ah Kerioth Hezron which is Hazor Amam Shema Moladah Hazar Gaddah Heshmon Beth Pelet Hazar Shual Beersheba Bizjothjah Baalah Ijim Ezem Eltolad Chesil Hormah Ziklag Madmannah Sansannah Lebaoth Shilhim Ain and Rimmon all the ci es are twenty nine with their villages

In the wilderness Beth Arabah Middin Secacah Nibshan the City of Salt and En Gedi six ci es with their villages
As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem the children of Judah could not drive them out but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day
The lot fell to the children of Joseph from the Jordan by Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho through the mountains to Bethel then went out from Bethel to Luz passed along to the border of the Archites at Ataroth and went down westward to the boundary of the Japhle tes as far as the boundary of Lower Beth Horon to Gezer and it ended at the sea
So the children of Joseph Manasseh and Ephraim took their inheritance
The border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Beth Horon
And the border went out toward the sea on the north side of Michmethath then the border went around eastward to Taanath Shiloh and passed by it on the east of Janohah
Then it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and Naarah reached to Jericho and came out at the Jordan
The border went out from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah and it ended at the sea
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families
The separate ci es for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh all the ci es with their villages
And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day and have become forced laborers
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh for he was the firstborn of Joseph namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh the father of Gilead because he was a man of war therefore he was given Gilead and Bashan
And there was a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families for the children of Abiezer the children of Helek the children of Asriel the children of Shechem the children of Hepher and the children of Shemida these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families
But Zelophehad the son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh had no sons but only daughters
And these are the names of his daughters Mahlah Noah Hoglah Milcah and Tirzah
And they came near before Eleazar the priest before Joshua the son of Nun and before the rulers saying The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers
Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among their father s brothers
Ten shares fell to Manasseh besides the land of Gilead and Bashan which were on the other side of the Jordan because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons and the rest of Manasseh s sons had the land of Gilead
And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath that lies east of Shechem and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah
Manasseh had the land of Tappuah but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim
And the border descended to the Brook Kanah southward to the brook
These ci es of Ephraim are among the ci es of Manasseh
The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and it ended at the sea
Southward it was Ephraim s northward it was Manasseh s and the sea was its border
Manasseh s territory was adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east
And in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth Shean and its towns Ibleam and its towns the inhabitants of Dor and its towns the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns three hilly regions
Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those ci es but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land
And it happened when the children of Israel grew strong that they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not u erly drive them out
Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua saying Why have you given us only one lot and one share to inherit since we are a great people inasmuch as the LORD has blessed us un l now So Joshua answered them If you are a great people then go up to the forest country and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you
But the children of Joseph said The mountain country is not enough for us and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both those who are of Beth Shean and its towns and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel
And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph to Ephraim and Manasseh saying You are a great people and have great power you shall not have only one lot but the mountain country shall be yours
Although it is wooded you shall cut it down and its farthest extent shall be yours for you shall drive out the Canaanites though they have iron chariots and are strong
Now the whole congrega on of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of mee ng there
And the land was subdued before them
But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance
Then Joshua said to the children of Israel How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers has given you Pick out from among you three men for each tribe and I will send them they shall rise and go through the land survey it according to their inheritance and come back to me
And they shall divide it into seven parts
Judah shall remain in their territory on the south and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north
You shall therefore survey the land in seven parts and bring the survey here to me that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God
But the Levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance
And Gad Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them
Then the men arose to go away and Joshua charged those who went to survey the land saying Go walk through the land survey it and come back to me that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh
So the men went passed through the land and wrote the survey in a book in seven parts by ci es and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh
Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions
Now the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families and the territory of their lot came out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph

From Heleph the border extended westward to Aznoth Tabor and went out from there toward Hukkok it adjoined Zebulun on the south side and Asher on the west side and ended at Judah by the Jordan toward the sunrise
And the for fied ci es are Ziddim Zer Hammath Rakkath Chinnereth Adamah Ramah Hazor Kedesh Edrei En Hazor Iron Migdal El Horem Beth Anath and Beth Shemesh nineteen ci es with their villages
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families the ci es and their villages
The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families
And the territory of their inheritance was Zorah Eshtaol Ir Shemesh Shaalabbin Aijalon Jethlah Elon Timnah Ekron Eltekeh Gibbethon Baalath Jehud Bene Berak Gath Rimmon Me Jarkon and Rakkon with the region near Joppa
And the border of the children of Dan went beyond these because the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem and took it and they struck it with the edge of the sword took possession of it and dwelt in it
They called Leshem Dan a er the name of Dan their father
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families these ci es with their villages
When they had made an end of dividing the land as an inheritance according to their borders the children of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun
According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked for Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim and he built the city and dwelt in it
These were the inheritances which Eleazar the priest Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided as an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of mee ng
So they made an end of dividing the country
The LORD also spoke to Joshua saying Speak to the children of Israel saying Appoint for yourselves ci es of refuge of which I spoke to you through Moses that the slayer who kills a person accidentally or uninten onally may flee there and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood
And when he flees to one of those ci es and stands at the entrance of the gate of the city and declares his case in the hearing of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city as one of them and give him a place that he may dwell among them
Then if the avenger of blood pursues him they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand because he struck his neighbor uninten onally but did not hate him beforehand
And he shall dwell in that city un l he stands before the congrega on for judgment and un l the death of the one who is high priest in those days
Then the slayer may return and come to his own city and his own house to the city from which he fled
So they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in the mountains of Naphtali Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim and Kirjath Arba which is Hebron in the mountains of Judah
And on the other side of the Jordan by Jericho eastward they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh
These were the ci es appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwelt among them that whoever killed a person accidentally might flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood un l he stood before the congrega on
Then the heads of the fathers houses of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the children of Israel
And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan saying The LORD commanded through Moses to give us ci es to dwell in with their common lands for our livestock
So the children of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance at the commandment of the LORD these ci es and their common lands Now the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites
And the children of Aaron the priest who were of the Levites had thirteen ci es by lot from the tribe of Judah from the tribe of Simeon and from the tribe of Benjamin
The rest of the children of Kohath had ten ci es by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim from the tribe of Dan and from the half tribe of Manasseh
And the children of Gershon had thirteen ci es by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar from the tribe of Asher from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan
The children of Merari according to their families had twelve ci es from the tribe of Reuben from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun
And the children of Israel gave these ci es with their common lands by lot to the Levites as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses
So they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah and from the tribe of the children of Simeon these ci es which are designated by name which were for the children of Aaron one of the families of the Kohathites who were of the children of Levi for the lot was theirs first
And they gave them Kirjath Arba Arba was the father of Anak which is Hebron in the mountains of Judah with the common land surrounding it
But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession
Thus to the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its common land a city of refuge for the slayer Libnah with its common land Ja r with its common land Eshtemoa with its common land Holon with its common land Debir with its common land Ain with its common land Ju ah with its common land and Beth Shemesh with its common land nine ci es from those two tribes and from the tribe of Benjamin Gibeon with its common land Geba with its common land Anathoth with its common land and Almon with its common land four ci es
All the ci es of the children of Aaron the priests were thirteen ci es with their common lands
And the families of the children of Kohath the Levites the rest of the children of Kohath even they had the ci es of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim
For they gave them Shechem with its common land in the mountains of Ephraim a city of refuge for the slayer Gezer with its common land Kibzaim with its common land and Beth Horon with its common land four ci es and from the tribe of Dan Eltekeh with its common land Gibbethon with its common land Aijalon with its common land and Gath Rimmon with its common land four ci es and from the half tribe of Manasseh Tanach with its common land and Gath Rimmon with its common land two ci es
All the ten ci es with their common lands were for the rest of the families of the children of Kohath
Also to the children of Gershon of the families of the Levites from the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with its common land a city of refuge for the slayer and Be Eshterah with its common land two ci es and from the tribe of Issachar Kishion with its common land Daberath with its common land Jarmuth with its common land and En Gannim with its common land four ci es and from the tribe of Asher Mishal with its common land Abdon with its common land Helkath with its common land and Rehob with its common land four ci es and from the tribe of Naphtali Kedesh in Galilee with its common land a city of refuge for the slayer Hammoth Dor with its common land and Kartan with its common land three ci es
All the ci es of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen ci es with their common lands
And to the families of the children of Merari the rest of the Levites from the tribe of Zebulun Jokneam with its common land Kartah with its common land Dimnah with its common land and Nahalal with its common land four ci es and from the tribe of Reuben Bezer with its common land Jahaz with its common land Kedemoth with its common land and Mephaath with its common land four ci es and from the tribe of Gad Ramoth in Gilead with its common land a city of refuge for the slayer Mahanaim with its common land Heshbon with its common land and Jazer with its common land four ci es in all
So all the ci es for the children of Merari according to their families the rest of the families of the Levites were by their lot twelve ci es
All the ci es of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty eight ci es with their common lands
Every one of these ci es had its common land surrounding it thus were all these ci es
So the LORD gave to Israel all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers and they took possession of it and dwelt in it
The LORD gave them rest all around according to all that He had sworn to their fathers
And not a man of all their enemies stood against them the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand
Not a word failed of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel
All came to pass
Then Joshua called the Reubenites the Gadites and half the tribe of Manasseh and said to them You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you
You have not le your brethren these many days up to this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God
And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brethren as He promised them now therefore return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan
But take careful heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you to love the LORD your God to walk in all His ways to keep His commandments to hold fast to Him and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul
So Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went to their tents
Now to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan westward
And indeed when Joshua sent them away to their tents he blessed them and spoke to them saying Return with much riches to your tents with very much livestock with silver with gold with bronze with iron and with very much clothing
Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren
So the children of Reuben the children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan to go to the country of Gilead to the land of their possession which they had obtained according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses
And when they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan the children of Reuben the children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan a great impressive altar
Now the children of Israel heard someone say Behold the children of Reuben the children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the fron er of the land of Canaan in the region of the Jordan on the children of Israel s side
And when the children of Israel heard of it the whole congrega on of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them
Then the children of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the children of Reuben to the children of Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead and with him ten rulers one ruler each from the chief house of every tribe of Israel and each one was the head of the house of his father among the divisions of Israel
Then they came to the children of Reuben to the children of Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh to the land of Gilead and they spoke with them saying Thus says the whole congrega on of the LORD What treachery is this that you have commi ed against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the LORD in that you have built for yourselves an altar that you might rebel this day against the LORD Is the iniquity of Peor not enough for us from which we are not cleansed un l this day although there was a plague in the congrega on of the LORD but that you must turn away this day from following the LORD And it shall be if you rebel today against the LORD that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congrega on of Israel
Nevertheless if the land of your possession is unclean then cross over to the land of the possession of the LORD where the LORD S tabernacle stands and take possession among us but do not rebel against the LORD nor rebel against us by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God
Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congrega on of Israel And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity
Then the children of Reuben the children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the divisions of Israel The LORD God of gods the LORD God of gods He knows and let Israel itself know if it is in rebellion or if in treachery against the LORD do not save us this day
If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following the LORD or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings or if to offer peace offerings on it let the LORD Himself require an account
But in fact we have done it for fear for a reason saying In me to come your descendants may speak to our descendants saying What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between you and us you children of Reuben and children of Gad
You have no part in the LORD
So your descendants would make our descendants cease fearing the LORD
Therefore we said Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but that it may be a witness between you and us and our genera ons a er us that we may perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your descendants may not say to our descendants in me to come You have no part in the LORD
Therefore we said that it will be when they say this to us or to our genera ons in me to come that we may say Here is the replica of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between you and us
Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn from following the LORD this day to build an altar for burnt offerings for grain offerings or for sacrifices besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle
Now when Phinehas the priest and the rulers of the congrega on the heads of the divisions of Israel who were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke it pleased them
Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh This day we perceive that the LORD is among us because you have not commi ed this treachery against the LORD
Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the rulers returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan to the children of Israel and brought back word to them
So the thing pleased the children of Israel and the children of Israel blessed God they spoke no more of going against them in ba le to destroy the land where the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt
The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Witness For it is a witness between us that the LORD is God
Now it came to pass a long me a er the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua was old advanced in age
And Joshua called for all Israel for their elders for their heads for their judges and for their officers and said to them I am old advanced in age
You have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these na ons because of you for the LORD your God is He who has fought for you
See I have divided to you by lot these na ons that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from the Jordan with all the na ons that I have cut off as far as the Great Sea westward
And the LORD your God will expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight
So you shall possess their land as the LORD your God promised you
Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is wri en in the Book of the Law of Moses lest you turn aside from it to the right hand or to the le and lest you go among these na ons these who remain among you
You shall not make men on of the name of their gods nor cause anyone to swear by them you shall not serve them nor bow down to them but you shall hold fast to the LORD your God as you have done to this day
For the LORD has driven out from before you great and strong na ons but as for you no one has been able to stand against you to this day
One man of you shall chase a thousand for the LORD your God is He who fights for you as He promised you
Therefore take careful heed to yourselves that you love the LORD your God
Or else if indeed you do go back and cling to the remnant of these na ons these that remain among you and make marriages with them and go in to them and they to you know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these na ons from before you
But they shall be snares and traps to you and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes un l you perish from this good land which the LORD your God has given you
Behold this day I am going the way of all the earth
And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you
All have come to pass for you not one word of them has failed
Therefore it shall come to pass that as all the good things have come upon you which the LORD your God promised you so the LORD will bring upon you all harmful things un l He has destroyed you from this good land which the LORD your God has given you
When you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God which He commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed down to them then the anger of the LORD will burn against you and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you
Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel for their heads for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God
And Joshua said to all the people Thus says the LORD God of Israel Your fathers including Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor dwelt on the other side of the River in old mes and they served other gods
Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River led him throughout all the land of Canaan and mul plied his descendants and gave him Isaac
To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau
To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt
Also I sent Moses and Aaron and I plagued Egypt according to what I did among them
A erward I brought you out
Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea and the Egyp ans pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea
So they cried out to the LORD and He put darkness between you and the Egyp ans brought the sea upon them and covered them
And your eyes saw what I did in Egypt
Then you dwelt in the wilderness a long me
And I brought you into the land of the Amorites who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan and they fought with you
But I gave them into your hand that you might possess their land and I destroyed them from before you
Then Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab arose to make war against Israel and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you
But I would not listen to Balaam therefore he con nued to bless you
So I delivered you out of his hand
Then you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho
And the men of Jericho fought against you also the Amorites the Perizzites the Canaanites the Hi tes the Girgashites the Hivites and the Jebusites
But I delivered them into your hand
I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you also the two kings of the Amorites but not with your sword or with your bow
I have given you a land for which you did not labor and ci es which you did not build and you dwell in them you eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant
Now therefore fear the LORD serve Him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt
Serve the LORD And if it seems evil to you to serve the LORD choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell
But as for me and my house we will serve the LORD
So the people answered and said Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed
And the LORD drove out from before us all the people including the Amorites who dwelt in the land
We also will serve the LORD for He is our God
But Joshua said to the people You cannot serve the LORD for He is a holy God
He is a jealous God He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins
If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods then He will turn and do you harm and consume you a er He has done you good
And the people said to Joshua No but we will serve the LORD So Joshua said to the people You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD for yourselves to serve Him
And they said We are witnesses Now therefore he said put away the foreign gods which are among you and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel
And the people said to Joshua The LORD our God we will serve and His voice we will obey So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem
Then Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God
And he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD
And Joshua said to all the people Behold this stone shall be a witness to us for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us
It shall therefore be a witness to you lest you deny your God
So Joshua let the people depart each to his own inheritance
Now it came to pass a er these things that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died being one hundred and ten years old
And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah which is in the mountains of Ephraim on the north side of Mount Gaash
Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua who had known all the works of the LORD which He had done for Israel
The bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt they buried at Shechem in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died
They buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son which was given to him in the mountains of Ephraim
Judges Now a er the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the LORD saying Who shall be first to go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them And the LORD said Judah shall go up
Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand
So Judah said to Simeon his brother Come up with me to my allo ed territory that we may fight against the Canaanites and I will likewise go with you to your allo ed territory
And Simeon went with him
Then Judah went up and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek
And they found Adoni Bezek in Bezek and fought against him and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites
Then Adoni Bezek fled and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes
And Adoni Bezek said Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table as I have done so God has repaid me
Then they brought him to Jerusalem and there he died
Now the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire
And a erward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains in the South and in the lowland
Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron
Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba
And they killed Sheshai Ahiman and Talmai
From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir
The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher
Then Caleb said Whoever a acks Kirjath Sepher and takes it to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife
And Othniel the son of Kenaz Caleb s younger brother took it so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife
Now it happened when she came to him that she urged him to ask her father for a field
And she dismounted from her donkey and Caleb said to her What do you wish So she said to him Give me a blessing since you have given me land in the South give me also springs of water
And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs
Now the children of the Kenite Moses father in law went up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah which lies in the South near Arad and they went and dwelt among the people
And Judah went with his brother Simeon and they a acked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and u erly destroyed it
So the name of the city was called Hormah
Also Judah took Gaza with its territory Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory
So the LORD was with Judah
And they drove out the mountaineers but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland because they had chariots of iron
And they gave Hebron to Caleb as Moses had said
Then he expelled from there the three sons of Anak
But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day
And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel and the LORD was with them
So the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel
The name of the city was formerly Luz
And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city they said to him Please show us the entrance to the city and we will show you mercy
So he showed them the entrance to the city and they struck the city with the edge of the sword but they let the man and all his family go
And the man went to the land of the Hi tes built a city and called its name Luz which is its name to this day
However Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages or Taanach and its villages or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land
And it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites under tribute but did not completely drive them out
Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them
Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol so the Canaanites dwelt among them and were put under tribute
Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab Achzib Helbah Aphik or Rehob
So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out
Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath but they dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land
Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains for they would not allow them to come down to the valley and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater they were put under tribute
Now the boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim from Sela and upward
Then the Angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said I led you up from Egypt and brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers and I said I will never break My covenant with you
And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land you shall tear down their altars
But you have not obeyed My voice
Why have you done this Therefore I also said I will not drive them out before you but they shall be thorns in your side and their gods shall be a snare to you
So it was when the Angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel that the people li ed up their voices and wept
Then they called the name of that place Bochim and they sacrificed there to the LORD
And when Joshua had dismissed the people the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land
So the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the LORD which He had done for Israel
Now Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died when he was one hundred and ten years old
And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres in the mountains of Ephraim on the north side of Mount Gaash
When all that genera on had been gathered to their fathers another genera on arose a er them who did not know the LORD nor the work which He had done for Israel
Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers who had brought them out of the land of Egypt and they followed other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them and they bowed down to them and they provoked the LORD to anger
They forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtoreths
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel
So He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around so that they could no longer stand before their enemies
Wherever they went out the hand of the LORD was against them for calamity as the LORD had said and as the LORD had sworn to them
And they were greatly distressed
Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them
Yet they would not listen to their judges but they played the harlot with other gods and bowed down to them
They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD they did not do so
And when the LORD raised up judges for them the LORD was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them
And it came to pass when the judge was dead that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers by following other gods to serve them and bow down to them
They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way
Then the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and He said Because this na on has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not heeded My voice I also will no longer drive out before them any of the na ons which Joshua le when he died so that through them I may test Israel whether they will keep the ways of the LORD to walk in them as their fathers kept them or not
Therefore the LORD le those na ons without driving them out immediately nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua
Now these are the na ons which the LORD le that He might test Israel by them that is all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan this was only so that the genera ons of the children of Israel might be taught to know war at least those who had not formerly known it namely five lords of the Philis nes all the Canaanites the Sidonians and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath
And they were le that He might test Israel by them to know whether they would obey the commandments of the LORD which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses
Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites the Hi tes the Amorites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites
And they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and they served their gods
So the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD
They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and Asherahs
Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and He sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years
When the children of Israel cried out to the LORD the LORD raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel who delivered them Othniel the son of Kenaz Caleb s younger brother
The Spirit of the LORD came upon him and he judged Israel
He went out to war and the LORD delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed over Cushan Rishathaim
So the land had rest for forty years
Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD
So the LORD strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD
Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek went and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms
So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years
But when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD the LORD raised up a deliverer for them Ehud the son of Gera the Benjamite a le handed man
By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab
Now Ehud made himself a dagger it was double edged and a cubit in length and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh
So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab
Now Eglon was a very fat man
And when he had finished presen ng the tribute he sent away the people who had carried the tribute
But he himself turned back from the stone images that were at Gilgal and said I have a secret message for you O king
He said Keep silence And all who a ended him went out from him
And Ehud came to him now he was si ng upstairs in his cool private chamber
Then Ehud said I have a message from God for you
So he arose from his seat
Then Ehud reached with his le hand took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly
Even the hilt went in a er the blade and the fat closed over the blade for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly and his entrails came out
Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them
When he had gone out Eglon s servants came to look and to their surprise the doors of the upper room were locked
So they said He is probably a ending to his needs in the cool chamber
So they waited ll they were embarrassed and s ll he had not opened the doors of the upper room
Therefore they took the key and opened them
And there was their master fallen dead on the floor
But Ehud had escaped while they delayed and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah
And it happened when he arrived that he blew the trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains and he led them
Then he said to them Follow me for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand
So they went down a er him seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab and did not allow anyone to cross over
And at that me they killed about ten thousand men of Moab all stout men of valor not a man escaped
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel
And the land had rest for eighty years
A er him was Shamgar the son of Anath who killed six hundred men of the Philis nes with an ox goad and he also delivered Israel
When Ehud was dead the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD
So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor
The commander of his army was Sisera who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim
And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD for Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron and for twenty years he harshly oppressed the children of Israel
Now Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lapidoth was judging Israel at that me
And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim
And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment
Then she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded Go and deploy troops at Mount Tabor take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun and against you I will deploy Sisera the commander of Jabin s army with his chariots and his mul tude at the River Kishon and I will deliver him into your hand And Barak said to her If you will go with me then I will go but if you will not go with me I will not go So she said I will surely go with you nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman
Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh
And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh he went up with ten thousand men under his command and Deborah went up with him
Now Heber the Kenite of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim which is beside Kedesh
And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor
So Sisera gathered together all his chariots nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people who were with him from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon
Then Deborah said to Barak Up For this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand
Has not the LORD gone out before you So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him
And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot
But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword not a man was le
However Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite
And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him Turn aside my lord turn aside to me do not fear
And when he had turned aside with her into the tent she covered him with a blanket
Then he said to her Please give me a li le water to drink for I am thirsty
So she opened a jug of milk gave him a drink and covered him
And he said to her Stand at the door of the tent and if any man comes and inquires of you and says Is there any man here you shall say No
Then Jael Heber s wife took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand and went so ly to him and drove the peg into his temple and it went down into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary
So he died
And then as Barak pursued Sisera Jael came out to meet him and said to him Come I will show you the man whom you seek
And when he went into her tent there lay Sisera dead with the peg in his temple
So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel
And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan un l they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan
Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day saying When leaders lead in Israel When the people willingly offer themselves Bless the LORD Hear O kings Give ear O princes I even I will sing to the LORD I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel
LORD when You went out from Seir When You marched from the field of Edom The earth trembled and the heavens poured The clouds also poured water The mountains gushed before the LORD This Sinai before the LORD God of Israel
In the days of Shamgar son of Anath In the days of Jael The highways were deserted And the travelers walked along the byways
Village life ceased it ceased in Israel Un l I Deborah arose Arose a mother in Israel
They chose new gods Then there was war in the gates Not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel
My heart is with the rulers of Israel Who offered themselves willingly with the people
Bless the LORD Speak you who ride on white donkeys Who sit in judges a re And who walk along the road
Far from the noise of the archers among the watering places There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD The righteous acts for His villagers in Israel Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates
Awake awake Deborah Awake awake sing a song Arise Barak and lead your cap ves away O son of Abinoam Then the survivors came down the people against the nobles The LORD came down for me against the mighty
From Ephraim were those whose roots were in Amalek
A er you Benjamin with your peoples From Machir rulers came down And from Zebulun those who bear the recruiter s staff
And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah As Issachar so was Barak Sent into the valley under his command Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart
Why did you sit among the sheepfolds To hear the pipings for the flocks The divisions of Reuben have great searchings of heart
Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan And why did Dan remain on ships Asher con nued at the seashore And stayed by his inlets
Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to the point of death Naphtali also on the heights of the ba lefield
The kings came and fought Then the kings of Canaan fought In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo They took no spoils of silver
They fought from the heavens The stars from their courses fought against Sisera
The torrent of Kishon swept them away That ancient torrent the torrent of Kishon
O my soul march on in strength Then the horses hooves pounded The galloping galloping of his steeds
Curse Meroz said the angel of the LORD Curse its inhabitants bi erly Because they did not come to the help of the LORD To the help of the LORD against the mighty
Most blessed among women is Jael The wife of Heber the Kenite Blessed is she among women in tents
He asked for water she gave milk She brought out cream in a lordly bowl
She stretched her hand to the tent peg Her right hand to the workmen s hammer She pounded Sisera she pierced his head She split and struck through his temple
At her feet he sank he fell he lay s ll At her feet he sank he fell Where he sank there he fell dead
The mother of Sisera looked through the window And cried out through the la ce Why is his chariot so long in coming Why tarries the cla er of his chariots Her wisest ladies answered her Yes she answered herself Are they not finding and dividing the spoil To every man a girl or two For Sisera plunder of dyed garments Plunder of garments embroidered and dyed Two pieces of dyed embroidery for the neck of the looter Thus let all Your enemies perish O LORD But let those who love Him be like the sun When it comes out in full strength
So the land had rest for forty years
Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD
So the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel
Because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the dens the caves and the strongholds which are in the mountains
So it was whenever Israel had sown Midianites would come up also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them
Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza and leave no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor ox nor donkey
For they would come up with their livestock and their tents coming in as numerous as locusts both they and their camels were without number and they would enter the land to destroy it
So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD
And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD because of the Midianites that the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel who said to them Thus says the LORD God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp ans and out of the hand of all who oppressed you and drove them out before you and gave you their land
Also I said to you I am the LORD your God do not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell
But you have not obeyed My voice
Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from the Midianites
And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him The LORD is with you you mighty man of valor Gideon said to Him O my lord if the LORD is with us why then has all this happened to us And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about saying Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites
Then the LORD turned to him and said Go in this might of yours and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites
Have I not sent you So he said to Him O my Lord how can I save Israel Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least in my father s house
And the LORD said to him Surely I will be with you and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man
Then he said to Him If now I have found favor in Your sight then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me
Do not depart from here I pray un l I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You
And He said I will wait un l you come back
So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour
The meat he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them
The Angel of God said to him Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock and pour out the broth
And he did so
Then the Angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread
And the Angel of the LORD departed out of his sight
Now Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the LORD
So Gideon said Alas O Lord GOD For I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face
Then the LORD said to him Peace be with you do not fear you shall not die
So Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it The LORD Is Peace
To this day it is s ll in Ophrah of the Abiezrites
Now it came to pass the same night that the LORD said to him Take your father s young bull the second bull of seven years old and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has and cut down the wooden image that is beside it and build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down
So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the LORD had said to him
But because he feared his father s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day he did it by night
And when the men of the city arose early in the morning there was the altar of Baal torn down and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built
So they said to one another Who has done this thing And when they had inquired and asked they said Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing
Then the men of the city said to Joash Bring out your son that he may die because he has torn down the altar of Baal and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it
But Joash said to all who stood against him Would you plead for Baal Would you save him Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning If he is a god let him plead for himself because his altar has been torn down Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal saying Let Baal plead against him because he has torn down his altar
Then all the Midianites and Amalekites the people of the East gathered together and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel
But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon then he blew the trumpet and the Abiezrites gathered behind him
And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh who also gathered behind him
He also sent messengers to Asher Zebulun and Naphtali and they came up to meet them
So Gideon said to God If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said look I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor if there is dew on the fleece only and it is dry on all the ground then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand as You have said
And it was so
When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together he wrung the dew out of the fleece a bowlful of water
Then Gideon said to God Do not be angry with me but let me speak just once more Let me test I pray just once more with the fleece let it now be dry only on the fleece but on all the ground let there be dew
And God did so that night
It was dry on the fleece only but there was dew on all the ground
Then Jerubbaal that is Gideon and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the well of Harod so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley
And the LORD said to Gideon The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands lest Israel claim glory for itself against Me saying My own hand has saved me
Now therefore proclaim in the hearing of the people saying Whoever is fearful and afraid let him turn and depart at once from Mount Gilead
And twenty two thousand of the people returned and ten thousand remained
But the LORD said to Gideon The people are s ll too many bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there
Then it will be that of whom I say to you This one shall go with you the same shall go with you and of whomever I say to you This one shall not go with you the same shall not go
So he brought the people down to the water
And the LORD said to Gideon Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue as a dog laps you shall set apart by himself likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink
And the number of those who lapped pu ng their hand to their mouth was three hundred men but all the rest of the people got down on their knees to drink water
Then the LORD said to Gideon By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand
Let all the other people go every man to his place
So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands
And he sent away all the rest of Israel every man to his tent and retained those three hundred men
Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley
It happened on the same night that the LORD said to him Arise go down against the camp for I have delivered it into your hand
But if you are afraid to go down go down to the camp with Purah your servant and you shall hear what they say and a erward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp
Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp
Now the Midianites and Amalekites all the people of the East were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts and their camels were without number as the sand by the seashore in mul tude
And when Gideon had come there was a man telling a dream to his companion
He said I have had a dream To my surprise a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned and the tent collapsed
Then his companion answered and said This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash a man of Israel Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp
And so it was when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpreta on that he worshiped
He returned to the camp of Israel and said Arise for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand
Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet into every man s hand with empty pitchers and torches inside the pitchers
And he said to them Look at me and do likewise watch and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do When I blow the trumpet I and all who are with me then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp and say The sword of the LORD and of Gideon So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch just as they had posted the watch and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands
Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers they held the torches in their le hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing and they cried The sword of the LORD and of Gideon And every man stood in his place all around the camp and the whole army ran and cried out and fled
When the three hundred blew the trumpets the LORD set every man s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp and the army fled to Beth Acacia toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah by Tabbath
And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali Asher and all Manasseh and pursued the Midianites
Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim saying Come down against the Midianites and seize from them the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan
Then all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan
And they captured two princes of the Midianites Oreb and Zeeb
They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb
They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan
Now the men of Ephraim said to him Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites And they reprimanded him sharply
So he said to them What have I done now in comparison with you Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim be er than the vintage of Abiezer God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian Oreb and Zeeb
And what was I able to do in comparison with you Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that
When Gideon came to the Jordan he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over exhausted but s ll in pursuit
Then he said to the men of Succoth Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me for they are exhausted and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna kings of Midian
And the leaders of Succoth said Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand that we should give bread to your army So Gideon said For this cause when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way
And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered
So he also spoke to the men of Penuel saying When I come back in peace I will tear down this tower Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor and their armies with them about fi een thousand all who were le of all the army of the people of the East for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen
Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah and he a acked the army while the camp felt secure
When Zebah and Zalmunna fled he pursued them and he took the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna and routed the whole army
Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from ba le from the Ascent of Heres
And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders seventy seven men
Then he came to the men of Succoth and said Here are Zebah and Zalmunna about whom you ridiculed me saying Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand that we should give bread to your weary men And he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of Succoth
Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city
And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor So they answered As you are so were they each one resembled the son of a king
Then he said They were my brothers the sons of my mother
As the LORD lives if you had let them live I would not kill you
And he said to Jether his firstborn Rise kill them But the youth would not draw his sword for he was afraid because he was s ll a youth
So Zebah and Zalmunna said Rise yourself and kill us for as a man is so is his strength
So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels necks
Then the men of Israel said to Gideon Rule over us both you and your son and your grandson also for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian
But Gideon said to them I will not rule over you nor shall my son rule over you the LORD shall rule over you
Then Gideon said to them I would like to make a request of you that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder
For they had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites
So they answered We will gladly give them
And they spread out a garment and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder
Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold besides the crescent ornaments pendants and purple robes which were on the kings of Midian and besides the chains that were around their camels necks
Then Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city Ophrah
And all Israel played the harlot with it there
It became a snare to Gideon and to his house
Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel so that they li ed their heads no more
And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon
Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house
Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring for he had many wives
And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son whose name he called Abimelech
Now Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites
So it was as soon as Gideon was dead that the children of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals and made Baal Berith their god
Thus the children of Israel did not remember the LORD their God who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal Gideon in accordance with the good he had done for Israel
Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother s brothers and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother s father saying Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem Which is be er for you that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you or that one reign over you Remember that I am your own flesh and bone
And his mother s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech for they said He is our brother
So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal Berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men and they followed him
Then he went to his father s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the seventy sons of Jerubbaal on one stone
But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was le because he hid himself
And all the men of Shechem gathered together all of Beth Millo and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that was in Shechem
Now when they told Jotham he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and li ed his voice and cried out
And he said to them Listen to me you men of Shechem That God may listen to you The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them
And they said to the olive tree Reign over us But the olive tree said to them Should I cease giving my oil With which they honor God and men And go to sway over trees Then the trees said to the fig tree You come and reign over us But the fig tree said to them Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit And go to sway over trees Then the trees said to the vine You come and reign over us But the vine said to them Should I cease my new wine Which cheers both God and men And go to sway over trees Then all the trees said to the bramble You come and reign over us And the bramble said to the trees If in truth you anoint me as king over you Then come and take shelter in my shade But if not let fire come out of the bramble And devour the cedars of Lebanon Now therefore if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as he deserves for my father fought for you risked his life and delivered you out of the hand of Midian but you have risen up against my father s house this day and killed his seventy sons on one stone and made Abimelech the son of his female servant king over the men of Shechem because he is your brother if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice in Abimelech and let him also rejoice in you
But if not let fire come from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and Beth Millo and let fire come from the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and devour Abimelech And Jotham ran away and fled and he went to Beer and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech his brother
A er Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech that the crime done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be se led and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother who killed them and on the men of Shechem who aided him in the killing of his brothers
And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains and they robbed all who passed by them along that way and it was told Abimelech
Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him
So they went out into the fields and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them and made merry
And they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech
Then Gaal the son of Ebed said Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we should serve him Is he not the son of Jerubbaal and is not Zebul his officer Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem but why should we serve him If only this people were under my authority Then I would remove Abimelech
So he said to Abimelech Increase your army and come out When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed his anger was aroused
And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly saying Take note Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and here they are for fying the city against you
Now therefore get up by night you and the people who are with you and lie in wait in the field
And it shall be as soon as the sun is up in the morning that you shall rise early and rush upon the city and when he and the people who are with him come out against you you may then do to them as you find opportunity
So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies
When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait
And when Gaal saw the people he said to Zebul Look people are coming down from the tops of the mountains But Zebul said to him You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men
So Gaal spoke again and said See people are coming down from the center of the land and another company is coming from the Diviners Terebinth Tree
Then Zebul said to him Where indeed is your mouth now with which you said Who is Abimelech that we should serve him Are not these the people whom you despised Go out if you will and fight with them now
So Gaal went out leading the men of Shechem and fought with Abimelech
And Abimelech chased him and he fled from him and many fell wounded to the very entrance of the gate
Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers so that they would not dwell in Shechem
And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field and they told Abimelech
So he took his people divided them into three companies and lay in wait in the field
And he looked and there were the people coming out of the city and he rose against them and a acked them
Then Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and killed them
So Abimelech fought against the city all that day he took the city and killed the people who were in it and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt
Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard that they entered the stronghold of the temple of the god Berith
And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together
Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon he and all the people who were with him
And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder then he said to the people who were with him What you have seen me do make haste and do as I have done
So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech put them against the stronghold and set the stronghold on fire above them so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died about a thousand men and women
Then Abimelech went to Thebez and he encamped against Thebez and took it
But there was a strong tower in the city and all the men and women all the people of the city fled there and shut themselves in then they went up to the top of the tower
So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire
But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech s head and crushed his skull
Then he called quickly to the young man his armorbearer and said to him Draw your sword and kill me lest men say of me A woman killed him
So his young man thrust him through and he died
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead they departed every man to his place
Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers
And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal
A er Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah the son of Dodo a man of Issachar and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim
He judged Israel twenty three years and he died and was buried in Shamir
A er him arose Jair a Gileadite and he judged Israel twenty two years
Now he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys they also had thirty towns which are called Havoth Jair to this day which are in the land of Gilead
And Jair died and was buried in Camon
Then the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths the gods of Syria the gods of Sidon the gods of Moab the gods of the people of Ammon and the gods of the Philis nes and they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him
So the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and He sold them into the hands of the Philis nes and into the hands of the people of Ammon
From that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites in Gilead
Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim so that Israel was severely distressed
And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD saying We have sinned against You because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals So the LORD said to the children of Israel Did I not deliver you from the Egyp ans and from the Amorites and from the people of Ammon and from the Philis nes Also the Sidonians and Amalekites and Maonites oppressed you and you cried out to Me and I delivered you from their hand
Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods
Therefore I will deliver you no more
Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen let them deliver you in your me of distress
And the children of Israel said to the LORD We have sinned Do to us whatever seems best to You only deliver us this day we pray
So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD
And His soul could no longer endure the misery of Israel
Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead
And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah
And the people the leaders of Gilead said to one another Who is the man who will begin the fight against the people of Ammon He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead
Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor but he was the son of a harlot and Gilead begot Jephthah
Gilead s wife bore sons and when his wife s sons grew up they drove Jephthah out and said to him You shall have no inheritance in our father s house for you are the son of another woman
Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob and worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out raiding with him
It came to pass a er a me that the people of Ammon made war against Israel
And so it was when the people of Ammon made war against Israel that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob
Then they said to Jephthah Come and be our commander that we may fight against the people of Ammon
So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead Did you not hate me and expel me from my father s house Why have you come to me now when you are in distress And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah That is why we have turned again to you now that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead
So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon and the LORD delivers them to me shall I be your head And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah The LORD will be a witness between us if we do not do according to your words
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead and the people made him head and commander over them and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD in Mizpah
Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon saying What do you have against me that you have come to fight against me in my land And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and to the Jordan
Now therefore restore those lands peaceably
So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon and said to him Thus says Jephthah Israel did not take away the land of Moab nor the land of the people of Ammon for when Israel came up from Egypt they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh
Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom saying Please let me pass through your land
But the king of Edom would not heed
And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab but he would not consent
So Israel remained in Kadesh
And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab came to the east side of the land of Moab and encamped on the other side of the Arnon
But they did not enter the border of Moab for the Arnon was the border of Moab
Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites king of Heshbon and Israel said to him Please let us pass through your land into our place
But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory
So Sihon gathered all his people together encamped in Jahaz and fought against Israel
And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel and they defeated them
Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites who inhabited that country
They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan
And now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel should you then possess it Will you not possess whatever Chemosh your god gives you to possess So whatever the LORD our God takes possession of before us we will possess
And now are you any be er than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab Did he ever strive against Israel Did he ever fight against them While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages in Aroer and its villages and in all the ci es along the banks of the Arnon for three hundred years why did you not recover them within that me Therefore I have not sinned against you but you wronged me by figh ng against me
May the LORD the Judge render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon
However the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed through Mizpah of Gilead and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon
And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the people of Ammon shall surely be the LORD S and I will offer it up as a burnt offering
So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them and the LORD delivered them into his hands
And he defeated them from Aroer as far as Minnith twenty ci es and to Abel Keramim with a very great slaughter
Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel
When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah there was his daughter coming out to meet him with mbrels and dancing and she was his only child
Besides her he had neither son nor daughter
And it came to pass when he saw her that he tore his clothes and said Alas my daughter You have brought me very low You are among those who trouble me For I have given my word to the LORD and I cannot go back on it
So she said to him My father if you have given your word to the LORD do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth because the LORD has avenged you of your enemies the people of Ammon
Then she said to her father Let this thing be done for me let me alone for two months that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity my friends and I
So he said Go
And he sent her away for two months and she went with her friends and bewailed her virginity on the mountains
And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father and he carried out his vow with her which he had vowed
She knew no man
And it became a custom in Israel that the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
Then the men of Ephraim gathered together crossed over toward Zaphon and said to Jephthah Why did you cross over to fight against the people of Ammon and did not call us to go with you We will burn your house down on you with fire And Jephthah said to them My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon and when I called you you did not deliver me out of their hands
So when I saw that you would not deliver me I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon and the LORD delivered them into my hand
Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim
And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim because they said You Gileadites are fugi ves of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites
The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived
And when any Ephraimite who escaped said Let me cross over the men of Gilead would say to him Are you an Ephraimite If he said No then they would say to him Then say Shibboleth And he would say Sibboleth for he could not pronounce it right
Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan
There fell at that me forty two thousand Ephraimites
And Jephthah judged Israel six years
Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in among the ci es of Gilead
A er him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel
He had thirty sons
And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons
He judged Israel seven years
Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem
A er him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel
He judged Israel ten years
And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun
A er him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel
He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy young donkeys
He judged Israel eight years
Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim in the mountains of the Amalekites
Again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philis nes for forty years
Now there was a certain man from Zorah of the family of the Danites whose name was Manoah and his wife was barren and had no children
And the Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her Indeed now you are barren and have borne no children but you shall conceive and bear a son
Now therefore please be careful not to drink wine or similar drink and not to eat anything unclean
For behold you shall conceive and bear a son
And no razor shall come upon his head for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philis nes
So the woman came and told her husband saying A Man of God came to me and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God very awesome but I did not ask Him where He was from and He did not tell me His name
And He said to me Behold you shall conceive and bear a son
Now drink no wine or similar drink nor eat anything unclean for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death
Then Manoah prayed to the LORD and said O my Lord please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born
And God listened to the voice of Manoah and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was si ng in the field but Manoah her husband was not with her
Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband and said to him Look the Man who came to me the other day has just now appeared to me So Manoah arose and followed his wife
When he came to the Man he said to Him Are You the Man who spoke to this woman And He said I am
Manoah said Now let Your words come to pass What will be the boy s rule of life and his work So the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful
She may not eat anything that comes from the vine nor may she drink wine or similar drink nor eat anything unclean
All that I commanded her let her observe
Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD Please let us detain You and we will prepare a young goat for You
And the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah Though you detain Me I will not eat your food
But if you offer a burnt offering you must offer it to the LORD
For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the LORD
Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD What is Your name that when Your words come to pass we may honor You And the Angel of the LORD said to him Why do you ask My name seeing it is wonderful So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it upon the rock to the LORD
And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar the Angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar When Manoah and his wife saw this they fell on their faces to the ground
When the Angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and his wife then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of the LORD
And Manoah said to his wife We shall surely die because we have seen God But his wife said to him If the LORD had desired to kill us He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands nor would He have shown us all these things nor would He have told us such things as these at this me
So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson and the child grew and the LORD blessed him
And the Spirit of the LORD began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol
Now Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philis nes
So he went up and told his father and mother saying I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philis nes now therefore get her for me as a wife
Then his father and mother said to him Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren or among all my people that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philis nes And Samson said to his father Get her for me for she pleases me well
But his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philis nes
For at that me the Philis nes had dominion over Israel
So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah
Now to his surprise a young lion came roaring against him
And the Spirit of the LORD came migh ly upon him and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat though he had nothing in his hand
But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done
Then he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased Samson well
A er some me when he returned to get her he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion
And behold a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion
He took some of it in his hands and went along ea ng
When he came to his father and mother he gave some to them and they also ate
But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion
So his father went down to the woman
And Samson gave a feast there for young men used to do so
And it happened when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him
Then Samson said to them Let me pose a riddle to you
If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing
But if you cannot explain it to me then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing
And they said to him Pose your riddle that we may hear it
So he said to them Out of the eater came something to eat And out of the strong came something sweet
Now for three days they could not explain the riddle
But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson s wife En ce your husband that he may explain the riddle to us or else we will burn you and your father s house with fire
Have you invited us in order to take what is ours Is that not so Then Samson s wife wept on him and said You only hate me You do not love me You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people but you have not explained it to me
And he said to her Look I have not explained it to my father or my mother so should I explain it to you Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted
And it happened on the seventh day that he told her because she pressed him so much
Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people
So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down What is sweeter than honey And what is stronger than a lion And he said to them If you had not plowed with my heifer You would not have solved my riddle Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him migh ly and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men took their apparel and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle
So his anger was aroused and he went back up to his father s house
And Samson s wife was given to his companion who had been his best man
A er a while in the me of wheat harvest it happened that Samson visited his wife with a young goat
And he said Let me go in to my wife into her room
But her father would not permit him to go in
Her father said I really thought that you thoroughly hated her therefore I gave her to your companion
Is not her younger sister be er than she Please take her instead
And Samson said to them This me I shall be blameless regarding the Philis nes if I harm them Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes and he took torches turned the foxes tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails
When he had set the torches on fire he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philis nes and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain as well as the vineyards and olive groves
Then the Philis nes said Who has done this And they answered Samson the son in law of the Timnite because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion
So the Philis nes came up and burned her and her father with fire
Samson said to them Since you would do a thing like this I will surely take revenge on you and a er that I will cease
So he a acked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter then he went down and dwelt in the cle of the rock of Etam
Now the Philis nes went up encamped in Judah and deployed themselves against Lehi
And the men of Judah said Why have you come up against us So they answered We have come up to arrest Samson to do to him as he has done to us
Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cle of the rock of Etam and said to Samson Do you not know that the Philis nes rule over us What is this you have done to us And he said to them As they did to me so I have done to them
But they said to him We have come down to arrest you that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philis nes
Then Samson said to them Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves
So they spoke to him saying No but we will e you securely and deliver you into their hand but we will surely not kill you
And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock
When he came to Lehi the Philis nes came shou ng against him
Then the Spirit of the LORD came migh ly upon him and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire and his bonds broke loose from his hands
He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey reached out his hand and took it and killed a thousand men with it
Then Samson said With the jawbone of a donkey Heaps upon heaps With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men And so it was when he had finished speaking that he threw the jawbone from his hand and called that place Ramath Lehi
Then he became very thirsty so he cried out to the LORD and said You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised So God split the hollow place that is in Lehi and water came out and he drank and his spirit returned and he revived
Therefore he called its name En Hakkore which is in Lehi to this day
And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philis nes
Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there and went in to her
When the Gazites were told Samson has come here they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city
They were quiet all night saying In the morning when it is daylight we will kill him
And Samson lay low ll midnight then he arose at midnight took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts pulled them up bar and all put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron
A erward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah
And the lords of the Philis nes came up to her and said to her En ce him and find out where his great strength lies and by what means we may overpower him that we may bind him to afflict him and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver
So Delilah said to Samson Please tell me where your great strength lies and with what you may be bound to afflict you
And Samson said to her If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings not yet dried then I shall become weak and be like any other man
So the lords of the Philis nes brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings not yet dried and she bound him with them
Now men were lying in wait staying with her in the room
And she said to him The Philis nes are upon you Samson But he broke the bowstrings as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire
So the secret of his strength was not known
Then Delilah said to Samson Look you have mocked me and told me lies
Now please tell me what you may be bound with
So he said to her If they bind me securely with new ropes that have never been used then I shall become weak and be like any other man
Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him The Philis nes are upon you Samson And men were lying in wait staying in the room
But he broke them off his arms like a thread
Delilah said to Samson Un l now you have mocked me and told me lies
Tell me what you may be bound with
And he said to her If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom So she wove it ghtly with the ba en of the loom and said to him The Philis nes are upon you Samson But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the ba en and the web from the loom
Then she said to him How can you say I love you when your heart is not with me You have mocked me these three mes and have not told me where your great strength lies
And it came to pass when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him so that his soul was vexed to death that he told her all his heart and said to her No razor has ever come upon my head for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother s womb
If I am shaven then my strength will leave me and I shall become weak and be like any other man
When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the Philis nes saying Come up once more for he has told me all his heart
So the lords of the Philis nes came up to her and brought the money in their hand
Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head
Then she began to torment him and his strength le him
And she said The Philis nes are upon you Samson So he awoke from his sleep and said I will go out as before at other mes and shake myself free But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him
Then the Philis nes took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza
They bound him with bronze fe ers and he became a grinder in the prison
However the hair of his head began to grow again a er it had been shaven
Now the lords of the Philis nes gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice
And they said Our god has delivered into our hands Samson our enemy When the people saw him they praised their god for they said Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy The destroyer of our land And the one who mul plied our dead
So it happened when their hearts were merry that they said Call for Samson that he may perform for us
So they called for Samson from the prison and he performed for them
And they sta oned him between the pillars
Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand Let me feel the pillars which support the temple so that I can lean on them
Now the temple was full of men and women
All the lords of the Philis nes were there about three thousand men and women on the roof watching while Samson performed
Then Samson called to the LORD saying O Lord GOD remember me I pray Strengthen me I pray just this once O God that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philis nes for my two eyes And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple and he braced himself against them one on his right and the other on his le
Then Samson said Let me die with the Philis nes And he pushed with all his might and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who were in it
So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life
And his brothers and all his father s household came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah
He had judged Israel twenty years
Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim whose name was Micah
And he said to his mother The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and on which you put a curse even saying it in my ears here is the silver with me I took it
And his mother said May you be blessed by the LORD my son So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a molded image now therefore I will return it to you
Thus he returned the silver to his mother
Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith and he made it into a carved image and a molded image and they were in the house of Micah
The man Micah had a shrine and made an ephod and household idols and he consecrated one of his sons who became his priest
In those days there was no king in Israel everyone did what was right in his own eyes
Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah of the family of Judah he was a Levite and was staying there
The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find a place
Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim to the house of Micah as he journeyed
And Micah said to him Where do you come from So he said to him I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah and I am on my way to find a place to stay
Micah said to him Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year a suit of clothes and your sustenance
So the Levite went in
Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man became like one of his sons to him
So Micah consecrated the Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah
Then Micah said Now I know that the LORD will be good to me since I have a Levite as priest In those days there was no king in Israel
And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in for un l that day their inheritance among the tribes of Israel had not fallen to them
So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and search it
They said to them Go search the land
So they went to the mountains of Ephraim to the house of Micah and lodged there
While they were at the house of Micah they recognized the voice of the young Levite
They turned aside and said to him Who brought you here What are you doing in this place What do you have here He said to them Thus and so Micah did for me
He has hired me and I have become his priest
So they said to him Please inquire of God that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous
And the priest said to them Go in peace
The presence of the LORD be with you on your way
So the five men departed and went to Laish
They saw the people who were there how they dwelt safely in the manner of the Sidonians quiet and secure
There were no rulers in the land who might put them to shame for anything
They were far from the Sidonians and they had no es with anyone
Then the spies came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol and their brethren said to them What is your report So they said Arise let us go up against them
For we have seen the land and indeed it is very good
Would you do nothing Do not hesitate to go and enter to possess the land
When you go you will come to a secure people and a large land
For God has given it into your hands a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth
And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there from Zorah and Eshtaol armed with weapons of war
Then they went up and encamped in Kirjath Jearim in Judah
Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day
There it is west of Kirjath Jearim
And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah
Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod household idols a carved image and a molded image Now therefore consider what you should do
So they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite man to the house of Micah and greeted him
The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war who were of the children of Dan stood by the entrance of the gate
Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up
Entering there they took the carved image the ephod the household idols and the molded image
The priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were armed with weapons of war
When these went into Micah s house and took the carved image the ephod the household idols and the molded image the priest said to them What are you doing And they said to him Be quiet put your hand over your mouth and come with us be a father and a priest to us
Is it be er for you to be a priest to the household of one man or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel So the priest s heart was glad and he took the ephod the household idols and the carved image and took his place among the people
Then they turned and departed and put the li le ones the livestock and the goods in front of them
When they were a good way from the house of Micah the men who were in the houses near Micah s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan
And they called out to the children of Dan
So they turned around and said to Micah What ails you that you have gathered such a company So he said You have taken away my gods which I made and the priest and you have gone away
Now what more do I have How can you say to me What ails you And the children of Dan said to him Do not let your voice be heard among us lest angry men fall upon you and you lose your life with the lives of your household Then the children of Dan went their way
And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back to his house
So they took the things Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him and went to Laish to a people quiet and secure and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire
There was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon and they had no es with anyone
It was in the valley that belongs to Beth Rehob
So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there
And they called the name of the city Dan a er the name of Dan their father who was born to Israel
However the name of the city formerly was Laish
Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image and Jonathan the son of Gershom the son of Manasseh and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan un l the day of the cap vity of the land
So they set up for themselves Micah s carved image which he made all the me that the house of God was in Shiloh
And it came to pass in those days when there was no king in Israel that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote mountains of Ephraim
He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah
But his concubine played the harlot against him and went away from him to her father s house at Bethlehem in Judah and was there four whole months
Then her husband arose and went a er her to speak kindly to her and bring her back having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him
So she brought him into her father s house and when the father of the young woman saw him he was glad to meet him
Now his father in law the young woman s father detained him and he stayed with him three days
So they ate and drank and lodged there
Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning and he stood to depart but the young woman s father said to his son in law Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread and a erward go your way
So they sat down and the two of them ate and drank together
Then the young woman s father said to the man Please be content to stay all night and let your heart be merry
And when the man stood to depart his father in law urged him so he lodged there again
Then he arose early in the morning on the fi h day to depart but the young woman s father said Please refresh your heart
So they delayed un l a ernoon and both of them ate
And when the man stood to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the young woman s father said to him Look the day is now drawing toward evening please spend the night
See the day is coming to an end lodge here that your heart may be merry
Tomorrow go your way early so that you may get home
However the man was not willing to spend that night so he rose and departed and came to opposite Jebus that is Jerusalem
With him were the two saddled donkeys his concubine was also with him
They were near Jebus and the day was far spent and the servant said to his master Come please and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it
But his master said to him We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners who are not of the children of Israel we will go on to Gibeah
So he said to his servant Come let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah
And they passed by and went their way and the sun went down on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin
They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah
And when he went in he sat down in the open square of the city for no one would take them into his house to spend the night
Just then an old man came in from his work in the field at evening who also was from the mountains of Ephraim he was staying in Gibeah whereas the men of the place were Benjamites
And when he raised his eyes he saw the traveler in the open square of the city and the old man said Where are you going and where do you come from So he said to him We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim I am from there
I went to Bethlehem in Judah now I am going to the house of the LORD
But there is no one who will take me into his house although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for myself for your female servant and for the young man who is with your servant there is no lack of anything
And the old man said Peace be with you However let all your needs be my responsibility only do not spend the night in the open square
So he brought him into his house and gave fodder to the donkeys
And they washed their feet and ate and drank
As they were enjoying themselves suddenly certain men of the city perverted men surrounded the house and beat on the door
They spoke to the master of the house the old man saying Bring out the man who came to your house that we may know him carnally But the man the master of the house went out to them and said to them No my brethren I beg you do not act so wickedly Seeing this man has come into my house do not commit this outrage
Look here is my virgin daughter and the man s concubine let me bring them out now
Humble them and do with them as you please but to this man do not do such a vile thing But the men would not heed him
So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them
And they knew her and abused her all night un l morning and when the day began to break they let her go
Then the woman came as the day was dawning and fell down at the door of the man s house where her master was ll it was light
When her master arose in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way there was his concubine fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold
And he said to her Get up and let us be going
But there was no answer
So the man li ed her onto the donkey and the man got up and went to his place
When he entered his house he took a knife laid hold of his concubine and divided her into twelve pieces limb by limb and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel
And so it was that all who saw it said No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt un l this day
Consider it confer and speak up So all the children of Israel came out from Dan to Beersheba as well as from the land of Gilead and the congrega on gathered together as one man before the LORD at Mizpah
And the leaders of all the people all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword
Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah
Then the children of Israel said Tell us how did this wicked deed happen So the Levite the husband of the woman who was murdered answered and said My concubine and I went into Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin to spend the night
And the men of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house at night because of me
They intended to kill me but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died
So I took hold of my concubine cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel because they commi ed lewdness and outrage in Israel
Look All of you are children of Israel give your advice and counsel here and now So all the people arose as one man saying None of us will go to his tent nor will any turn back to his house but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah We will go up against it by lot
We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel a hundred out of every thousand and a thousand out of every ten thousand to make provisions for the people that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city united together as one man
Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying What is this wickedness that has occurred among you Now therefore deliver up the men the perverted men who are in Gibeah that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel
Instead the children of Benjamin gathered together from their ci es to Gibeah to go to ba le against the children of Israel
And from their ci es at that me the children of Benjamin numbered twenty six thousand men who drew the sword besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who numbered seven hundred select men
Among all this people were seven hundred select men who were le handed every one could sling a stone at a hair s breadth and not miss
Now besides Benjamin the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword all of these were men of war
Then the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God
They said Which of us shall go up first to ba le against the children of Benjamin The LORD said Judah first So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah
And the men of Israel went out to ba le against Benjamin and the men of Israel put themselves in ba le array to fight against them at Gibeah
Then the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and on that day cut down to the ground twenty two thousand men of the Israelites
And the people that is the men of Israel encouraged themselves and again formed the ba le line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day
Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD un l evening and asked counsel of the LORD saying Shall I again draw near for ba le against the children of my brother Benjamin And the LORD said Go up against him
So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day
And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel all these drew the sword
Then all the children of Israel that is all the people went up and came to the house of God and wept
They sat there before the LORD and fasted that day un l evening and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD
So the children of Israel inquired of the LORD the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days saying Shall I yet again go out to ba le against the children of my brother Benjamin or shall I cease And the LORD said Go up for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand
Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah
And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day and put themselves in ba le array against Gibeah as at the other mes
So the children of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city
They began to strike down and kill some of the people as at the other mes in the highways one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah and in the field about thirty men of Israel
And the children of Benjamin said They are defeated before us as at first
But the children of Israel said Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways
So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in ba le array at Baal Tamar
Then Israel s men in ambush burst forth from their posi on in the plain of Geba
And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah and the ba le was fierce
But the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them
The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel
And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty five thousand one hundred Benjamites all these drew the sword
So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated
The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah
And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword
Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city whereupon the men of Israel would turn in ba le
Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel
For they said Surely they are defeated before us as in the first ba le
But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke the Benjamites looked behind them and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven
And when the men of Israel turned back the men of Benjamin panicked for they saw that disaster had come upon them
Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direc on of the wilderness but the ba le overtook them and whoever came out of the ci es they destroyed in their midst
They surrounded the Benjamites chased them and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the east
And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell all these were men of valor
Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways
Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom and killed two thousand of them
So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty five thousand men who drew the sword all these were men of valor
But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months
And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin and struck them down with the edge of the sword from every city men and beasts all who were found
They also set fire to all the ci es they came to
Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah saying None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife
Then the people came to the house of God and remained there before God ll evening
They li ed up their voices and wept bi erly and said O LORD God of Israel why has this come to pass in Israel that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel So it was on the next morning that the people rose early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
The children of Israel said Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the LORD For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the LORD at Mizpah saying He shall surely be put to death
And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother and said One tribe is cut off from Israel today
What shall we do for wives for those who remain seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them our daughters as wives And they said What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the LORD And in fact no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly
For when the people were counted indeed not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there
So the congrega on sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men and commanded them saying Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword including the women and children
And this is the thing that you shall do You shall u erly destroy every male and every woman who has known a man in mately
So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man in mately and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan
Then the whole congrega on sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and announced peace to them
So Benjamin came back at that me and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead and yet they had not found enough for them
And the people grieved for Benjamin because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel
Then the elders of the congrega on said What shall we do for wives for those who remain since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed And they said There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel
However we cannot give them wives from our daughters for the children of Israel have sworn an oath saying Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin
Then they said In fact there is a yearly feast of the LORD in Shiloh which is north of Bethel on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah
Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin saying Go lie in wait in the vineyards and watch and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances then come out from the vineyards and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh then go to the land of Benjamin
Then it shall be when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain that we will say to them Be kind to them for our sakes because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this me making yourselves guilty of your oath
And the children of Benjamin did so they took enough wives for their number from those who danced whom they caught
Then they went and returned to their inheritance and they rebuilt the ci es and dwelt in them
So the children of Israel departed from there at that me every man to his tribe and family they went out from there every man to his inheritance
In those days there was no king in Israel everyone did what was right in his own eyes
Ruth Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land
And a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to dwell in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons
The name of the man was Elimelech the name of his wife was Naomi and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah
And they went to the country of Moab and remained there
Then Elimelech Naomi s husband died and she was le and her two sons
Now they took wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth
And they dwelt there about ten years
Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died so the woman survived her two sons and her husband
Then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD had visited His people by giving them bread
Therefore she went out from the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah
And Naomi said to her two daughters in law Go return each to her mother s house
The LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me
The LORD grant that you may find rest each in the house of her husband
Then she kissed them and they li ed up their voices and wept
And they said to her Surely we will return with you to your people
But Naomi said Turn back my daughters why will you go with me Are there s ll sons in my womb that they may be your husbands Turn back my daughters go for I am too old to have a husband
If I should say I have hope if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons would you wait for them ll they were grown Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands No my daughters for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me Then they li ed up their voices and wept again and Orpah kissed her mother in law but Ruth clung to her
And she said Look your sister in law has gone back to her people and to her gods return a er your sister in law
But Ruth said Entreat me not to leave you Or to turn back from following a er you For wherever you go I will go And wherever you lodge I will lodge Your people shall be my people And your God my God
Where you die I will die And there will I be buried
The LORD do so to me and more also If anything but death parts you and me
When she saw that she was determined to go with her she stopped speaking to her
Now the two of them went un l they came to Bethlehem
And it happened when they had come to Bethlehem that all the city was excited because of them and the women said Is this Naomi But she said to them Do not call me Naomi call me Mara for the Almighty has dealt very bi erly with me
I went out full and the LORD has brought me home again empty
Why do you call me Naomi since the LORD has tes fied against me and the Almighty has afflicted me So Naomi returned and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter in law with her who returned from the country of Moab
Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest
There was a rela ve of Naomi s husband a man of great wealth of the family of Elimelech
His name was Boaz
So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi Please let me go to the field and glean heads of grain a er him in whose sight I may find favor
And she said to her Go my daughter
Then she le and went and gleaned in the field a er the reapers
And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz who was of the family of Elimelech
Now behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers The LORD be with you And they answered him The LORD bless you Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers Whose young woman is this So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab
And she said Please let me glean and gather a er the reapers among the sheaves
So she came and has con nued from morning un l now though she rested a li le in the house
Then Boaz said to Ruth You will listen my daughter will you not Do not go to glean in another field nor go from here but stay close by my young women
Let your eyes be on the field which they reap and go a er them
Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you And when you are thirsty go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn
So she fell on her face bowed down to the ground and said to him Why have I found favor in your eyes that you should take no ce of me since I am a foreigner And Boaz answered and said to her It has been fully reported to me all that you have done for your mother in law since the death of your husband and how you have le your father and your mother and the land of your birth and have come to a people whom you did not know before
The LORD repay your work and a full reward be given you by the LORD God of Israel under whose wings you have come for refuge
Then she said Let me find favor in your sight my lord for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your maidservant though I am not like one of your maidservants
Now Boaz said to her at meal me Come here and eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar
So she sat beside the reapers and he passed parched grain to her and she ate and was sa sfied and kept some back
And when she rose up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not reproach her
Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her leave it that she may glean and do not rebuke her
So she gleaned in the field un l evening and beat out what she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley
Then she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned
So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back a er she had been sa sfied
And her mother in law said to her Where have you gleaned today And where did you work Blessed be the one who took no ce of you
So she told her mother in law with whom she had worked and said The man s name with whom I worked today is Boaz
Then Naomi said to her daughter in law Blessed be he of the LORD who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead And Naomi said to her This man is a rela on of ours one of our close rela ves
Ruth the Moabitess said He also said to me You shall stay close by my young men un l they have finished all my harvest
And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter in law It is good my daughter that you go out with his young women and that people do not meet you in any other field
So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz to glean un l the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest and she dwelt with her mother in law
Then Naomi her mother in law said to her My daughter shall I not seek security for you that it may be well with you Now Boaz whose young women you were with is he not our rela ve In fact he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor
Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself put on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor but do not make yourself known to the man un l he has finished ea ng and drinking
Then it shall be when he lies down that you shall no ce the place where he lies and you shall go in uncover his feet and lie down and he will tell you what you should do
And she said to her All that you say to me I will do
So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother in law instructed her
And a er Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was cheerful he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain and she came so ly uncovered his feet and lay down
Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled and turned himself and there a woman was lying at his feet
And he said Who are you So she answered I am Ruth your maidservant
Take your maidservant under your wing for you are a close rela ve
Then he said Blessed are you of the LORD my daughter For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning in that you did not go a er young men whether poor or rich
And now my daughter do not fear
I will do for you all that you request for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman
Now it is true that I am a close rela ve however there is a rela ve closer than I
Stay this night and in the morning it shall be that if he will perform the duty of a close rela ve for you good let him do it
But if he does not want to perform the duty for you then I will perform the duty for you as the LORD lives Lie down un l morning
So she lay at his feet un l morning and she arose before one could recognize another
Then he said Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor
Also he said Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it
And when she held it he measured six ephahs of barley and laid it on her
Then she went into the city
So when she came to her mother in law she said Is that you my daughter Then she told her all that the man had done for her
And she said These six ephahs of barley he gave me for he said to me Do not go empty handed to your mother in law
Then she said Sit s ll my daughter un l you know how the ma er will turn out for the man will not rest un l he has concluded the ma er this day
Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there and behold the close rela ve of whom Boaz had spoken came by
So Boaz said Come aside friend sit down here
So he came aside and sat down
And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said Sit down here
So they sat down
Then he said to the close rela ve Naomi who has come back from the country of Moab sold the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech
And I thought to inform you saying Buy it back in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people
If you will redeem it redeem it but if you will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is no one but you to redeem it and I am next a er you
And he said I will redeem it
Then Boaz said On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the dead to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance
And the close rela ve said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I ruin my own inheritance
You redeem my right of redemp on for yourself for I cannot redeem it
Now this was the custom in former mes in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging to confirm anything one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other and this was a confirma on in Israel
Therefore the close rela ve said to Boaz Buy it for yourself
So he took off his sandal
And Boaz said to the elders and all the people You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech s and all that was Chilion s and Mahlon s from the hand of Naomi
Moreover Ruth the Moabitess the widow of Mahlon I have acquired as my wife to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his posi on at the gate
You are witnesses this day
And all the people who were at the gate and the elders said We are witnesses
The LORD make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah the two who built the house of Israel and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem
May your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah because of the offspring which the LORD will give you from this young woman
So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife and when he went in to her the LORD gave her concep on and she bore a son
Then the women said to Naomi Blessed be the LORD who has not le you this day without a close rela ve and may his name be famous in Israel And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age for your daughter in law who loves you who is be er to you than seven sons has borne him
Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom and became a nurse to him
Also the neighbor women gave him a name saying There is a son born to Naomi
And they called his name Obed
He is the father of Jesse the father of David
Now this is the genealogy of Perez Perez begot Hezron Hezron begot Ram and Ram begot Amminadab Amminadab begot Nahshon and Nahshon begot Salmon Salmon begot Boaz and Boaz begot Obed Obed begot Jesse and Jesse begot David
Samuel Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim of the mountains of Ephraim and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the son of Tohu the son of Zuph an Ephraimite
And he had two wives the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah
Peninnah had children but Hannah had no children
This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh
Also the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas the priests of the LORD were there
And whenever the me came for Elkanah to make an offering he would give por ons to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters
But to Hannah he would give a double por on for he loved Hannah although the LORD had closed her womb
And her rival also provoked her severely to make her miserable because the LORD had closed her womb
So it was year by year when she went up to the house of the LORD that she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat
Then Elkanah her husband said to her Hannah why do you weep Why do you not eat And why is your heart grieved Am I not be er to you than ten sons So Hannah arose a er they had finished ea ng and drinking in Shiloh
Now Eli the priest was si ng on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the LORD
And she was in bi erness of soul and prayed to the LORD and wept in anguish
Then she made a vow and said O LORD of hosts if You will indeed look on the afflic on of Your maidservant and remember me and not forget Your maidservant but will give Your maidservant a male child then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life and no razor shall come upon his head
And it happened as she con nued praying before the LORD that Eli watched her mouth
Now Hannah spoke in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard
Therefore Eli thought she was drunk
So Eli said to her How long will you be drunk Put your wine away from you And Hannah answered and said No my lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit
I have drunk neither wine nor intoxica ng drink but have poured out my soul before the LORD
Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken un l now
Then Eli answered and said Go in peace and the God of Israel grant your pe on which you have asked of Him
And she said Let your maidservant find favor in your sight
So the woman went her way and ate and her face was no longer sad
Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD and returned and came to their house at Ramah
And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the LORD remembered her
So it came to pass in the process of me that Hannah conceived and bore a son and called his name Samuel saying Because I have asked for him from the LORD
Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow
But Hannah did not go up for she said to her husband Not un l the child is weaned then I will take him that he may appear before the LORD and remain there forever
And Elkanah her husband said to her Do what seems best to you wait un l you have weaned him
Only let the LORD establish His word
So the woman stayed and nursed her son un l she had weaned him
Now when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bulls one ephah of flour and a skin of wine and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh
And the child was young
Then they slaughtered a bull and brought the child to Eli
And she said O my lord As your soul lives my lord I am the woman who stood by you here praying to the LORD
For this child I prayed and the LORD has granted me my pe on which I asked of Him
Therefore I also have lent him to the LORD as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD
So they worshiped the LORD there
And Hannah prayed and said My heart rejoices in the LORD My horn is exalted in the LORD
I smile at my enemies Because I rejoice in Your salva on
No one is holy like the LORD For there is none besides You Nor is there any rock like our God
Talk no more so very proudly Let no arrogance come from your mouth For the LORD is the God of knowledge And by Him ac ons are weighed
The bows of the mighty men are broken And those who stumbled are girded with strength
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread And the hungry have ceased to hunger
Even the barren has borne seven And she who has many children has become feeble
The LORD kills and makes alive He brings down to the grave and brings up
The LORD makes poor and makes rich He brings low and li s up
He raises the poor from the dust And li s the beggar from the ash heap To set them among princes And make them inherit the throne of glory
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD S And He has set the world upon them
He will guard the feet of His saints But the wicked shall be silent in darkness
For by strength no man shall prevail
The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken in pieces From heaven He will thunder against them
The LORD will judge the ends of the earth
He will give strength to His king And exalt the horn of His anointed
Then Elkanah went to his house at Ramah
But the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest
Now the sons of Eli were corrupt they did not know the LORD
And the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice the priest s servant would come with a three pronged fleshhook in his hand while the meat was boiling
Then he would thrust it into the pan or ke le or caldron or pot and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up
So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there
Also before they burned the fat the priest s servant would come and say to the man who sacrificed Give meat for roas ng to the priest for he will not take boiled meat from you but raw
And if the man said to him They should really burn the fat first then you may take as much as your heart desires he would then answer him No but you must give it now and if not I will take it by force
Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD for men abhorred the offering of the LORD
But Samuel ministered before the LORD even as a child wearing a linen ephod
Moreover his mother used to make him a li le robe and bring it to him year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice
And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say The LORD give you descendants from this woman for the loan that was given to the LORD
Then they would go to their own home
And the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters
Meanwhile the child Samuel grew before the LORD
Now Eli was very old and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of mee ng
So he said to them Why do you do such things For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people
No my sons For it is not a good report that I hear
You make the LORD S people transgress
If one man sins against another God will judge him
But if a man sins against the LORD who will intercede for him Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father because the LORD desired to kill them
And the child Samuel grew in stature and in favor both with the LORD and men
Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him Thus says the LORD Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh s house Did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest to offer upon My altar to burn incense and to wear an ephod before Me And did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling place and honor your sons more than Me to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people Therefore the LORD God of Israel says I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever
But now the LORD says Far be it from Me for those who honor Me I will honor and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed
Behold the days are coming that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father s house so that there will not be an old man in your house
And you will see an enemy in My dwelling place despite all the good which God does for Israel
And there shall not be an old man in your house forever
But any of your men whom I do not cut off from My altar shall consume your eyes and grieve your heart
And all the descendants of your house shall die in the flower of their age
Now this shall be a sign to you that will come upon your two sons on Hophni and Phinehas in one day they shall die both of them
Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind
I will build him a sure house and he shall walk before My anointed forever
And it shall come to pass that everyone who is le in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and say Please put me in one of the priestly posi ons that I may eat a piece of bread
Then the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli
And the word of the LORD was rare in those days there was no widespread revela on
And it came to pass at that me while Eli was lying down in his place and when his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he could not see and before the lamp of God went out in the tabernacle of the LORD where the ark of God was and while Samuel was lying down that the LORD called Samuel
And he answered Here I am So he ran to Eli and said Here I am for you called me
And he said I did not call lie down again
And he went and lay down
Then the LORD called yet again Samuel So Samuel arose and went to Eli and said Here I am for you called me
He answered I did not call my son lie down again
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD nor was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him
And the LORD called Samuel again the third me
Then he arose and went to Eli and said Here I am for you did call me
Then Eli perceived that the LORD had called the boy
Therefore Eli said to Samuel Go lie down and it shall be if He calls you that you must say Speak LORD for Your servant hears
So Samuel went and lay down in his place
Now the LORD came and stood and called as at other mes Samuel Samuel And Samuel answered Speak for Your servant hears
Then the LORD said to Samuel Behold I will do something in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will ngle
In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house from beginning to end
For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows because his sons made themselves vile and he did not restrain them
And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever
So Samuel lay down un l morning and opened the doors of the house of the LORD
And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision
Then Eli called Samuel and said Samuel my son And he answered Here I am
And he said What is the word that the LORD spoke to you Please do not hide it from me
God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you
Then Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him
And he said It is the LORD
Let Him do what seems good to Him
So Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground
And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel had been established as a prophet of the LORD
Then the LORD appeared again in Shiloh
For the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD
And the word of Samuel came to all Israel
Now Israel went out to ba le against the Philis nes and encamped beside Ebenezer and the Philis nes encamped in Aphek
Then the Philis nes put themselves in ba le array against Israel
And when they joined ba le Israel was defeated by the Philis nes who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field
And when the people had come into the camp the elders of Israel said Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philis nes Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh to us that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies
So the people sent to Shiloh that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts who dwells between the cherubim
And the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of God
And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook
Now when the Philis nes heard the noise of the shout they said What does the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp
So the Philis nes were afraid for they said God has come into the camp And they said Woe to us For such a thing has never happened before
Woe to us Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods These are the gods who struck the Egyp ans with all the plagues in the wilderness
Be strong and conduct yourselves like men you Philis nes that you do not become servants of the Hebrews as they have been to you
Conduct yourselves like men and fight So the Philis nes fought and Israel was defeated and every man fled to his tent
There was a very great slaughter and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers
Also the ark of God was captured and the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas died
Then a man of Benjamin ran from the ba le line the same day and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dirt on his head
Now when he came there was Eli si ng on a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of God
And when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out
When Eli heard the noise of the outcry he said What does the sound of this tumult mean And the man came quickly and told Eli
Eli was ninety eight years old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see
Then the man said to Eli I am he who came from the ba le
And I fled today from the ba le line
And he said What happened my son So the messenger answered and said Israel has fled before the Philis nes and there has been a great slaughter among the people
Also your two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead and the ark of God has been captured
Then it happened when he made men on of the ark of God that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck was broken and he died for the man was old and heavy
And he had judged Israel forty years
Now his daughter in law Phinehas wife was with child due to be delivered and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and gave birth for her labor pains came upon her
And about the me of her death the women who stood by her said to her Do not fear for you have borne a son
But she did not answer nor did she regard it
Then she named the child Ichabod saying The glory has departed from Israel because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father in law and her husband
And she said The glory has departed from Israel for the ark of God has been captured
Then the Philis nes took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod
When the Philis nes took the ark of God they brought it into the temple of Dagon and set it by Dagon
And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning there was Dagon fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the LORD
So they took Dagon and set it in its place again
And when they arose early the next morning there was Dagon fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the LORD
The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands were broken off on the threshold only Dagon s torso was le of it
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day
But the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod and He ravaged them and struck them with tumors both Ashdod and its territory
And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was they said The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god
Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the lords of the Philis nes and said What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel And they answered Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to Gath
So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away
So it was a er they had carried it away that the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruc on and He struck the men of the city both small and great and tumors broke out on them
Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron
So it was as the ark of God came to Ekron that the Ekronites cried out saying They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us to kill us and our people So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philis nes and said Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it go back to its own place so that it does not kill us and our people
For there was a deadly destruc on throughout all the city the hand of God was very heavy there
And the men who did not die were stricken with the tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven
Now the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philis nes seven months
And the Philis nes called for the priests and the diviners saying What shall we do with the ark of the LORD Tell us how we should send it to its place
So they said If you send away the ark of the God of Israel do not send it empty but by all means return it to Him with a trespass offering
Then you will be healed and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you
Then they said What is the trespass offering which we shall return to Him They answered Five golden tumors and five golden rats according to the number of the lords of the Philis nes
For the same plague was on all of you and on your lords
Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land and you shall give glory to the God of Israel perhaps He will lighten His hand from you from your gods and from your land
Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyp ans and Pharaoh hardened their hearts When He did mighty things among them did they not let the people go that they might depart Now therefore make a new cart take two milk cows which have never been yoked and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves home away from them
Then take the ark of the LORD and set it on the cart and put the ar cles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side
Then send it away and let it go
And watch if it goes up the road to its own territory to Beth Shemesh then He has done us this great evil
But if not then we shall know that it is not His hand that struck us it happened to us by chance
Then the men did so they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart and shut up their calves at home
And they set the ark of the LORD on the cart and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors
Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and did not turn aside to the right hand or the le
And the lords of the Philis nes went a er them to the border of Beth Shemesh
Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they li ed their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it
Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stood there a large stone was there
So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD
The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest that was with it in which were the ar cles of gold and put them on the large stone
Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the LORD
So when the five lords of the Philis nes had seen it they returned to Ekron the same day
These are the golden tumors which the Philis nes returned as a trespass offering to the LORD one for Ashdod one for Gaza one for Ashkelon one for Gath one for Ekron and the golden rats according to the number of all the ci es of the Philis nes belonging to the five lords both for fied ci es and country villages even as far as the large stone of Abel on which they set the ark of the LORD which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh
Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD
He struck fi y thousand and seventy men of the people and the people lamented because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter
And the men of Beth Shemesh said Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God And to whom shall it go up from us So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim saying The Philis nes have brought back the ark of the LORD come down and take it up with you
Then the men of Kirjath Jearim came and took the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD
So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long me it was there twenty years
And all the house of Israel lamented a er the LORD
Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel saying If you return to the LORD with all your hearts then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you and prepare your hearts for the LORD and serve Him only and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philis nes
So the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths and served the LORD only
And Samuel said Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the LORD for you
So they gathered together at Mizpah drew water and poured it out before the LORD
And they fasted that day and said there We have sinned against the LORD
And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah
Now when the Philis nes heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah the lords of the Philis nes went up against Israel
And when the children of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philis nes
So the children of Israel said to Samuel Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us that He may save us from the hand of the Philis nes
And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD
Then Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel and the LORD answered him
Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philis nes drew near to ba le against Israel
But the LORD thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philis nes that day and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philis nes and drove them back as far as below Beth Car
Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen and called its name Ebenezer saying Thus far the LORD has helped us
So the Philis nes were subdued and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel
And the hand of the LORD was against the Philis nes all the days of Samuel
Then the ci es which the Philis nes had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron to Gath and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philis nes
Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life
He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all those places
But he always returned to Ramah for his home was there
There he judged Israel and there he built an altar to the LORD
Now it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel
The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second Abijah they were judges in Beersheba
But his sons did not walk in his ways they turned aside a er dishonest gain took bribes and perverted jus ce
Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah and said to him Look you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways
Now make us a king to judge us like all the na ons
But the thing displeased Samuel when they said Give us a king to judge us
So Samuel prayed to the LORD
And the LORD said to Samuel Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you for they have not rejected you but they have rejected Me that I should not reign over them
According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods so they are doing to you also
Now therefore heed their voice
However you shall solemnly forewarn them and show them the behavior of the king who will reign over them
So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who asked him for a king
And he said This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen and some will run before his chariots
He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fi ies will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest and some to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots
He will take your daughters to be perfumers cooks and bakers
And he will take the best of your fields your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants
He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage and give it to his officers and servants
And he will take your male servants your female servants your finest young men and your donkeys and put them to his work
He will take a tenth of your sheep
And you will be his servants
And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves and the LORD will not hear you in that day
Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said No but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the na ons and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our ba les
And Samuel heard all the words of the people and he repeated them in the hearing of the LORD
So the LORD said to Samuel Heed their voice and make them a king
And Samuel said to the men of Israel Every man go to his city
There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel the son of Zeror the son of Bechorath the son of Aphiah a Benjamite a mighty man of power
And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul
There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel
From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people
Now the donkeys of Kish Saul s father were lost
And Kish said to his son Saul Please take one of the servants with you and arise go and look for the donkeys
So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha but they did not find them
Then they passed through the land of Shaalim and they were not there
Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites but they did not find them
When they had come to the land of Zuph Saul said to his servant who was with him Come let us return lest my father cease caring about the donkeys and become worried about us
And he said to him Look now there is in this city a man of God and he is an honorable man all that he says surely comes to pass
So let us go there perhaps he can show us the way that we should go
Then Saul said to his servant But look if we go what shall we bring the man For the bread in our vessels is all gone and there is no present to bring to the man of God
What do we have And the servant answered Saul again and said Look I have here at hand one fourth of a shekel of silver
I will give that to the man of God to tell us our way
Formerly in Israel when a man went to inquire of God he spoke thus Come let us go to the seer for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer
Then Saul said to his servant Well said come let us go
So they went to the city where the man of God was
As they went up the hill to the city they met some young women going out to draw water and said to them Is the seer here And they answered them and said Yes there he is just ahead of you
Hurry now for today he came to this city because there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place
As soon as you come into the city you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat
For the people will not eat un l he comes because he must bless the sacrifice a erward those who are invited will eat
Now therefore go up for about this me you will find him
So they went up to the city
As they were coming into the city there was Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place
Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came saying Tomorrow about this me I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel that he may save My people from the hand of the Philis nes for I have looked upon My people because their cry has come to me
And when Samuel saw Saul the LORD said to him There he is the man of whom I spoke to you
This one shall reign over My people
Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said Please tell me where is the seer s house And Samuel answered Saul and said I am the seer
Go up before me to the high place for you shall eat with me today and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart
But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago do not be anxious about them for they have been found
And on whom is all the desire of Israel Is it not on you and on all your father s house And Saul answered and said Am I not a Benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin Why then do you speak like this to me Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited there were about thirty persons
And Samuel said to the cook Bring the por on which I gave you of which I said to you Set it apart
So the cook took up the thigh with its upper part and set it before Saul
And Samuel said Here it is what was kept back
It was set apart for you
Eat for un l this me it has been kept for you since I said I invited the people
So Saul ate with Samuel that day
When they had come down from the high place into the city Samuel spoke with Saul on the top of the house
They arose early and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house saying Get up that I may send you on your way
And Saul arose and both of them went outside he and Samuel
As they were going down to the outskirts of the city Samuel said to Saul Tell the servant to go on ahead of us
And he went on
But you stand here awhile that I may announce to you the word of God
Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said Is it not because the LORD has anointed you commander over His inheritance When you have departed from me today you will find two men by Rachel s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah and they will say to you The donkeys which you went to look for have been found
And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about you saying What shall I do about my son Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor
There three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you one carrying three young goats another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a skin of wine
And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you shall receive from their hands
A er that you shall come to the hill of God where the Philis ne garrison is
And it will happen when you have come there to the city that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a stringed instrument a tambourine a flute and a harp before them and they will be prophesying
Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man
And let it be when these signs come to you that you do as the occasion demands for God is with you
You shall go down before me to Gilgal and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and make sacrifices of peace offerings
Seven days you shall wait ll I come to you and show you what you should do
So it was when he had turned his back to go from Samuel that God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day
When they came there to the hill there was a group of prophets to meet him then the Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied among them
And it happened when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets that the people said to one another What is this that has come upon the son of Kish Is Saul also among the prophets Then a man from there answered and said But who is their father Therefore it became a proverb Is Saul also among the prophets And when he had finished prophesying he went to the high place
Then Saul s uncle said to him and his servant Where did you go So he said To look for the donkeys
When we saw that they were nowhere to be found we went to Samuel
And Saul s uncle said Tell me please what Samuel said to you
So Saul said to his uncle He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found
But about the ma er of the kingdom he did not tell him what Samuel had said
Then Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah and said to the children of Israel Thus says the LORD God of Israel I brought up Israel out of Egypt and delivered you from the hand of the Egyp ans and from the hand of all kingdoms and from those who oppressed you
But you have today rejected your God who Himself saved you from all your adversi es and your tribula ons and you have said to Him No set a king over us Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near the tribe of Benjamin was chosen
When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families the family of Matri was chosen
And Saul the son of Kish was chosen
But when they sought him he could not be found
Therefore they inquired of the LORD further Has the man come here yet And the LORD answered There he is hidden among the equipment
So they ran and brought him from there and when he stood among the people he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward
And Samuel said to all the people Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen that there is no one like him among all the people So all the people shouted and said Long live the king Then Samuel explained to the people the behavior of royalty and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD
And Samuel sent all the people away every man to his house
And Saul also went home to Gibeah and valiant men went with him whose hearts God had touched
But some rebels said How can this man save us So they despised him and brought him no presents
But he held his peace
Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash Make a covenant with us and we will serve you
And Nahash the Ammonite answered them On this condi on I will make a covenant with you that I may put out all your right eyes and bring reproach on all Israel
Then the elders of Jabesh said to him Hold off for seven days that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel
And then if there is no one to save us we will come out to you
So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the hearing of the people
And all the people li ed up their voices and wept
Now there was Saul coming behind the herd from the field and Saul said What troubles the people that they weep And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh
Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news and his anger was greatly aroused
So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers saying Whoever does not go out with Saul and Samuel to ba le so it shall be done to his oxen
And the fear of the LORD fell on the people and they came out with one consent
When he numbered them in Bezek the children of Israel were three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand
And they said to the messengers who came Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead Tomorrow by the me the sun is hot you shall have help
Then the messengers came and reported it to the men of Jabesh and they were glad
Therefore the men of Jabesh said Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do with us whatever seems good to you
So it was on the next day that Saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and killed Ammonites un l the heat of the day
And it happened that those who survived were sca ered so that no two of them were le together
Then the people said to Samuel Who is he who said Shall Saul reign over us Bring the men that we may put them to death
But Saul said Not a man shall be put to death this day for today the LORD has accomplished salva on in Israel
Then Samuel said to the people Come let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there
So all the people went to Gilgal and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal
There they made sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly
Now Samuel said to all Israel Indeed I have heeded your voice in all that you said to me and have made a king over you
And now here is the king walking before you and I am old and grayheaded and look my sons are with you
I have walked before you from my childhood to this day
Here I am
Witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed Whose ox have I taken or whose donkey have I taken or whom have I cheated Whom have I oppressed or from whose hand have I received any bribe with which to blind my eyes I will restore it to you
And they said You have not cheated us or oppressed us nor have you taken anything from any man s hand
Then he said to them The LORD is witness against you and His anointed is witness this day that you have not found anything in my hand
And they answered He is witness
Then Samuel said to the people It is the LORD who raised up Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt
Now therefore stand s ll that I may reason with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did to you and your fathers When Jacob had gone into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the LORD then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place
And when they forgot the LORD their God He sold them into the hand of Sisera commander of the army of Hazor into the hand of the Philis nes and into the hand of the king of Moab and they fought against them
Then they cried out to the LORD and said We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies and we will serve You
And the LORD sent Jerubbaal Bedan Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and you dwelt in safety
And when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites came against you you said to me No but a king shall reign over us when the LORD your God was your king
Now therefore here is the king whom you have chosen and whom you have desired
And take note the LORD has set a king over you
If you fear the LORD and serve Him and obey His voice and do not rebel against the commandment of the LORD then both you and the king who reigns over you will con nue following the LORD your God
However if you do not obey the voice of the LORD but rebel against the commandment of the LORD then the hand of the LORD will be against you as it was against your fathers
Now therefore stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes Is today not the wheat harvest I will call to the LORD and He will send thunder and rain that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the LORD in asking a king for yourselves
So Samuel called to the LORD and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel
And all the people said to Samuel Pray for your servants to the LORD your God that we may not die for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking a king for ourselves
Then Samuel said to the people Do not fear
You have done all this wickedness yet do not turn aside from following the LORD but serve the LORD with all your heart
And do not turn aside for then you would go a er empty things which cannot profit or deliver for they are nothing
For the LORD will not forsake His people for His great name s sake because it has pleased the LORD to make you His people
Moreover as for me far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the right way
Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart for consider what great things He has done for you
But if you s ll do wickedly you shall be swept away both you and your king
Saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over Israel Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel
Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin
The rest of the people he sent away every man to his tent
And Jonathan a acked the garrison of the Philis nes that was in Geba and the Philis nes heard of it
Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying Let the Hebrews hear Now all Israel heard it said that Saul had a acked a garrison of the Philis nes and that Israel had also become an abomina on to the Philis nes
And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal
Then the Philis nes gathered together to fight with Israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the seashore in mul tude
And they came up and encamped in Michmash to the east of Beth Aven
When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger for the people were distressed then the people hid in caves in thickets in rocks in holes and in pits
And some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead
As for Saul he was s ll in Gilgal and all the people followed him trembling
Then he waited seven days according to the me set by Samuel
But Samuel did not come to Gilgal and the people were sca ered from him
So Saul said Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me
And he offered the burnt offering
Now it happened as soon as he had finished presen ng the burnt offering that Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might greet him
And Samuel said What have you done And Saul said When I saw that the people were sca ered from me and that you did not come within the days appointed and that the Philis nes gathered together at Michmash then I said The Philis nes will now come down on me at Gilgal and I have not made supplica on to the LORD
Therefore I felt compelled and offered a burnt offering
And Samuel said to Saul You have done foolishly
You have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God which He commanded you
For now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever
But now your kingdom shall not con nue
The LORD has sought for Himself a man a er His own heart and the LORD has commanded him to be commander over His people because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you
Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin
And Saul numbered the people present with him about six hundred men
Saul Jonathan his son and the people present with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin
But the Philis nes encamped in Michmash
Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philis nes in three companies
One company turned to the road to Ophrah to the land of Shual another company turned to the road to Beth Horon and another company turned to the road of the border that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness
Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel for the Philis nes said Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears
But all the Israelites would go down to the Philis nes to sharpen each man s plowshare his ma ock his ax and his sickle and the charge for a sharpening was a pim for the plowshares the ma ocks the forks and the axes and to set the points of the goads
So it came about on the day of ba le that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan
But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son
And the garrison of the Philis nes went out to the pass of Michmash
Now it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor Come let us go over to the Philis nes garrison that is on the other side
But he did not tell his father
And Saul was si ng in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron
The people who were with him were about six hundred men
Ahijah the son of Ahitub Ichabod s brother the son of Phinehas the son of Eli the LORD S priest in Shiloh was wearing an ephod
But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone
Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philis nes garrison there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side
And the name of one was Bozez and the name of the other Seneh
The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash and the other southward opposite Gibeah
Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor Come let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the LORD will work for us
For nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few
So his armorbearer said to him Do all that is in your heart
Go then here I am with you according to your heart
Then Jonathan said Very well let us cross over to these men and we will show ourselves to them
If they say thus to us Wait un l we come to you then we will stand s ll in our place and not go up to them
But if they say thus Come up to us then we will go up
For the LORD has delivered them into our hand and this will be a sign to us
So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philis nes
And the Philis nes said Look the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden
Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer and said Come up to us and we will show you something
Jonathan said to his armorbearer Come up a er me for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel
And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer a er him and they fell before Jonathan
And as he came a er him his armorbearer killed them
That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about half an acre of land
And there was trembling in the camp in the field and among all the people
The garrison and the raiders also trembled and the earth quaked so that it was a very great trembling
Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked and there was the mul tude mel ng away and they went here and there
Then Saul said to the people who were with him Now call the roll and see who has gone from us
And when they had called the roll surprisingly Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there
And Saul said to Ahijah Bring the ark of God here for at that me the ark of God was with the children of Israel
Now it happened while Saul talked to the priest that the noise which was in the camp of the Philis nes con nued to increase so Saul said to the priest Withdraw your hand
Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled and they went to the ba le and indeed every man s sword was against his neighbor and there was very great confusion
Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philis nes before that me who went up with them into the camp from the surrounding country they also joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan
Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim when they heard that the Philis nes fled they also followed hard a er them in the ba le
So the LORD saved Israel that day and the ba le shi ed to Beth Aven
And the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had placed the people under oath saying Cursed is the man who eats any food un l evening before I have taken vengeance on my enemies
So none of the people tasted food
Now all the people of the land came to a forest and there was honey on the ground
And when the people had come into the woods there was the honey dripping but no one put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath
But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his countenance brightened
Then one of the people said Your father strictly charged the people with an oath saying Cursed is the man who eats food this day
And the people were faint
But Jonathan said My father has troubled the land
Look now how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a li le of this honey
How much be er if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philis nes Now they had driven back the Philis nes that day from Michmash to Aijalon
So the people were very faint
And the people rushed on the spoil and took sheep oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and the people ate them with the blood
Then they told Saul saying Look the people are sinning against the LORD by ea ng with the blood So he said You have dealt treacherously roll a large stone to me this day
And Saul said Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them Bring me here every man s ox and every man s sheep slaughter them here and eat and do not sin against the LORD by ea ng with the blood
So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and slaughtered it there
Then Saul built an altar to the LORD
This was the first altar that he built to the LORD
Now Saul said Let us go down a er the Philis nes by night and plunder them un l the morning light and let us not leave a man of them
And they said Do whatever seems good to you
Then the priest said Let us draw near to God here
So Saul asked counsel of God Shall I go down a er the Philis nes Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel But He did not answer him that day
And Saul said Come over here all you chiefs of the people and know and see what this sin was today
For as the LORD lives who saves Israel though it be in Jonathan my son he shall surely die
But not a man among all the people answered him
Then he said to all Israel You be on one side and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side
And the people said to Saul Do what seems good to you
Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel Give a perfect lot
So Saul and Jonathan were taken but the people escaped
And Saul said Cast lots between my son Jonathan and me
So Jonathan was taken
Then Saul said to Jonathan Tell me what you have done
And Jonathan told him and said I only tasted a li le honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand
So now I must die And Saul answered God do so and more also for you shall surely die Jonathan
But the people said to Saul Shall Jonathan die who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel Certainly not As the LORD lives not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground for he has worked with God this day
So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die
Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philis nes and the Philis nes went to their own place
So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against Moab against the people of Ammon against Edom against the kings of Zobah and against the Philis nes
Wherever he turned he harassed them
And he gathered an army and a acked the Amalekites and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them
The sons of Saul were Jonathan Jishui and Malchishua
And the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal
The name of Saul s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz
And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner Saul s uncle
Kish was the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel
Now there was fierce war with the Philis nes all the days of Saul
And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him for himself
Samuel also said to Saul The LORD sent me to anoint you king over His people over Israel
Now therefore heed the voice of the words of the LORD
Thus says the LORD of hosts I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt
Now go and a ack Amalek and u erly destroy all that they have and do not spare them
But kill both man and woman infant and nursing child ox and sheep camel and donkey
So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah
And Saul came to a city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley
Then Saul said to the Kenites Go depart get down from among the Amalekites lest I destroy you with them
For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt
So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites
And Saul a acked the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur which is east of Egypt
He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive and u erly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword
But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep the oxen the fatlings the lambs and all that was good and were unwilling to u erly destroy them
But everything despised and worthless that they u erly destroyed
Now the word of the LORD came to Samuel saying I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king for he has turned back from following Me and has not performed My commandments
And it grieved Samuel and he cried out to the LORD all night
So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul it was told Samuel saying Saul went to Carmel and indeed he set up a monument for himself and he has gone on around passed by and gone down to Gilgal
Then Samuel went to Saul and Saul said to him Blessed are you of the LORD I have performed the commandment of the LORD
But Samuel said What then is this blea ng of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear And Saul said They have brought them from the Amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God and the rest we have u erly destroyed
Then Samuel said to Saul Be quiet And I will tell you what the LORD said to me last night
And he said to him Speak on
So Samuel said When you were li le in your own eyes were you not head of the tribes of Israel And did not the LORD anoint you king over Israel Now the LORD sent you on a mission and said Go and u erly destroy the sinners the Amalekites and fight against them un l they are consumed
Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD Why did you swoop down on the spoil and do evil in the sight of the LORD And Saul said to Samuel But I have obeyed the voice of the LORD and gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me and brought back Agag king of Amalek I have u erly destroyed the Amalekites
But the people took of the plunder sheep and oxen the best of the things which should have been u erly destroyed to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal
Then Samuel said Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD Behold to obey is be er than sacrifice And to heed than the fat of rams
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcra And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
Because you have rejected the word of the LORD He also has rejected you from being king
Then Saul said to Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice
Now therefore please pardon my sin and return with me that I may worship the LORD
But Samuel said to Saul I will not return with you for you have rejected the word of the LORD and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel
And as Samuel turned around to go away Saul seized the edge of his robe and it tore
So Samuel said to him The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is be er than you
And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor relent
For He is not a man that He should relent
Then he said I have sinned yet honor me now please before the elders of my people and before Israel and return with me that I may worship the LORD your God
So Samuel turned back a er Saul and Saul worshiped the LORD
Then Samuel said Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me
So Agag came to him cau ously
And Agag said Surely the bi erness of death is past
But Samuel said As your sword has made women childless so shall your mother be childless among women
And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal
Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul
And Samuel went no more to see Saul un l the day of his death
Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and the LORD regre ed that He had made Saul king over Israel
Now the LORD said to Samuel How long will you mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel Fill your horn with oil and go I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite
For I have provided Myself a king among his sons
And Samuel said How can I go If Saul hears it he will kill me
And the LORD said Take a heifer with you and say I have come to sacrifice to the LORD
Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what you shall do you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you
So Samuel did what the LORD said and went to Bethlehem
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said Do you come peaceably And he said Peaceably I have come to sacrifice to the LORD
Sanc fy yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice
Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice
So it was when they came that he looked at Eliab and said Surely the LORD S anointed is before Him
But the LORD said to Samuel Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature because I have refused him
For the LORD does not see as man sees for man looks at the outward appearance but the LORD looks at the heart
So Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel
And he said Neither has the LORD chosen this one
Then Jesse made Shammah pass by
And he said Neither has the LORD chosen this one
Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel
And Samuel said to Jesse The LORD has not chosen these
And Samuel said to Jesse Are all the young men here Then he said There remains yet the youngest and there he is keeping the sheep
And Samuel said to Jesse Send and bring him
For we will not sit down ll he comes here
So he sent and brought him in
Now he was ruddy with bright eyes and good looking
And the LORD said Arise anoint him for this is the one Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward
So Samuel arose and went to Ramah
But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul and a distressing spirit from the LORD troubled him
And Saul s servants said to him Surely a distressing spirit from God is troubling you
Let our master now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp and it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the distressing spirit from God is upon you and you shall be well
So Saul said to his servants Provide me now a man who can play well and bring him to me
Then one of the servants answered and said Look I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing a mighty man of valor a man of war prudent in speech and a handsome person and the LORD is with him
Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said Send me your son David who is with the sheep
And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by his son David to Saul
So David came to Saul and stood before him
And he loved him greatly and he became his armorbearer
Then Saul sent to Jesse saying Please let David stand before me for he has found favor in my sight
And so it was whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul that David would take a harp and play it with his hand
Then Saul would become refreshed and well and the distressing spirit would depart from him
Now the Philis nes gathered their armies together to ba le and were gathered together at Sochoh which belongs to Judah they encamped between Sochoh and Azekah in Ephes Dammim
And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and they encamped in the Valley of Elah and drew up in ba le array against the Philis nes
The Philis nes stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side with a valley between them
And a champion went out from the camp of the Philis nes named Goliath from Gath whose height was six cubits and a span
He had a bronze helmet on his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze
And he had bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders
Now the staff of his spear was like a weaver s beam and his iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels and a shield bearer went before him
Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel and said to them Why have you come out to line up for ba le Am I not a Philis ne and you the servants of Saul Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me
If he is able to fight with me and kill me then we will be your servants
But if I prevail against him and kill him then you shall be our servants and serve us
And the Philis ne said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together
When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philis ne they were dismayed and greatly afraid
Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah whose name was Jesse and who had eight sons
And the man was old advanced in years in the days of Saul
The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the ba le
The names of his three sons who went to the ba le were Eliab the firstborn next to him Abinadab and the third Shammah
David was the youngest
And the three oldest followed Saul
But David occasionally went and returned from Saul to feed his father s sheep at Bethlehem
And the Philis ne drew near and presented himself forty days morning and evening
Then Jesse said to his son David Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried grain and these ten loaves and run to your brothers at the camp
And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand and see how your brothers fare and bring back news of them
Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah figh ng with the Philis nes
So David rose early in the morning le the sheep with a keeper and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him
And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shou ng for the ba le
For Israel and the Philis nes had drawn up in ba le array army against army
And David le his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper ran to the army and came and greeted his brothers
Then as he talked with them there was the champion the Philis ne of Gath Goliath by name coming up from the armies of the Philis nes and he spoke according to the same words
So David heard them
And all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and were dreadfully afraid
So the men of Israel said Have you seen this man who has come up Surely he has come up to defy Israel and it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches will give him his daughter and give his father s house exemp on from taxes in Israel
Then David spoke to the men who stood by him saying What shall be done for the man who kills this Philis ne and takes away the reproach from Israel For who is this uncircumcised Philis ne that he should defy the armies of the living God And the people answered him in this manner saying So shall it be done for the man who kills him
Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men and Eliab s anger was aroused against David and he said Why did you come down here And with whom have you le those few sheep in the wilderness I know your pride and the insolence of your heart for you have come down to see the ba le
And David said What have I done now Is there not a cause Then he turned from him toward another and said the same thing and these people answered him as the first ones did
Now when the words which David spoke were heard they reported them to Saul and he sent for him
Then David said to Saul Let no man s heart fail because of him your servant will go and fight with this Philis ne
And Saul said to David You are not able to go against this Philis ne to fight with him for you are a youth and he a man of war from his youth
But David said to Saul Your servant used to keep his father s sheep and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock I went out a er it and struck it and delivered the lamb from its mouth and when it arose against me I caught it by its beard and struck and killed it
Your servant has killed both lion and bear and this uncircumcised Philis ne will be like one of them seeing he has defied the armies of the living God
Moreover David said The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear He will deliver me from the hand of this Philis ne
And Saul said to David Go and the LORD be with you So Saul clothed David with his armor and he put a bronze helmet on his head he also clothed him with a coat of mail
David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk for he had not tested them
And David said to Saul I cannot walk with these for I have not tested them
So David took them off
Then he took his staff in his hand and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook and put them in a shepherd s bag in a pouch which he had and his sling was in his hand
And he drew near to the Philis ne
So the Philis ne came and began drawing near to David and the man who bore the shield went before him
And when the Philis ne looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was only a youth ruddy and good looking
So the Philis ne said to David Am I a dog that you come to me with s cks And the Philis ne cursed David by his gods
And the Philis ne said to David Come to me and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field Then David said to the Philis ne You come to me with a sword with a spear and with a javelin
But I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom you have defied
This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand and I will strike you and take your head from you
And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philis nes to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel
Then all this assembly shall know that the LORD does not save with sword and spear for the ba le is the LORD S and He will give you into our hands
So it was when the Philis ne arose and came and drew near to meet David that David hastened and ran toward the army to meet the Philis ne
Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and he slung it and struck the Philis ne in his forehead so that the stone sank into his forehead and he fell on his face to the earth
So David prevailed over the Philis ne with a sling and a stone and struck the Philis ne and killed him
But there was no sword in the hand of David
Therefore David ran and stood over the Philis ne took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it
And when the Philis nes saw that their champion was dead they fled
Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philis nes as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron
And the wounded of the Philis nes fell along the road to Shaaraim even as far as Gath and Ekron
Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philis nes and they plundered their tents
And David took the head of the Philis ne and brought it to Jerusalem but he put his armor in his tent
When Saul saw David going out against the Philis ne he said to Abner the commander of the army Abner whose son is this youth And Abner said As your soul lives O king I do not know
So the king said Inquire whose son this young man is
Then as David returned from the slaughter of the Philis ne Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philis ne in his hand
And Saul said to him Whose son are you young man So David answered I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite
Now when he had finished speaking to Saul the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as his own soul
Saul took him that day and would not let him go home to his father s house anymore
Then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul
And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David with his armor even to his sword and his bow and his belt
So David went out wherever Saul sent him and behaved wisely
And Saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul s servants
Now it had happened as they were coming home when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philis ne that the women had come out of all the ci es of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tambourines with joy and with musical instruments
So the women sang as they danced and said Saul has slain his thousands And David his ten thousands
Then Saul was very angry and the saying displeased him and he said They have ascribed to David ten thousands and to me they have ascribed only thousands
Now what more can he have but the kingdom So Saul eyed David from that day forward
And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul and he prophesied inside the house
So David played music with his hand as at other mes but there was a spear in Saul s hand
And Saul cast the spear for he said I will pin David to the wall But David escaped his presence twice
Now Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul
Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people
And David behaved wisely in all his ways and the LORD was with him
Therefore when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely he was afraid of him
But all Israel and Judah loved David because he went out and came in before them
Then Saul said to David Here is my older daughter Merab I will give her to you as a wife
Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD S ba les
For Saul thought Let my hand not be against him but let the hand of the Philis nes be against him
So David said to Saul Who am I and what is my life or my father s family in Israel that I should be son in law to the king But it happened at the me when Merab Saul s daughter should have been given to David that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife
Now Michal Saul s daughter loved David
And they told Saul and the thing pleased him
So Saul said I will give her to him that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philis nes may be against him
Therefore Saul said to David a second me You shall be my son in law today
And Saul commanded his servants Communicate with David secretly and say Look the king has delight in you and all his servants love you
Now therefore become the king s son in law
So Saul s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David
And David said Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king s son in law seeing I am a poor and lightly esteemed man And the servants of Saul told him saying In this manner David spoke
Then Saul said Thus you shall say to David The king does not desire any dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philis nes to take vengeance on the king s enemies
But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philis nes
So when his servants told David these words it pleased David well to become the king s son in law
Now the days had not expired therefore David arose and went he and his men and killed two hundred men of the Philis nes
And David brought their foreskins and they gave them in full count to the king that he might become the king s son in law
Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife
Thus Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David and that Michal Saul s daughter loved him and Saul was s ll more afraid of David
So Saul became David s enemy con nually
Then the princes of the Philis nes went out to war
And so it was whenever they went out that David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul so that his name became highly esteemed
Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill David but Jonathan Saul s son delighted greatly in David
So Jonathan told David saying My father Saul seeks to kill you
Therefore please be on your guard un l morning and stay in a secret place and hide
And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are and I will speak with my father about you
Then what I observe I will tell you
Thus Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him Let not the king sin against his servant against David because he has not sinned against you and because his works have been very good toward you
For he took his life in his hands and killed the Philis ne and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel
You saw it and rejoiced
Why then will you sin against innocent blood to kill David without a cause So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan and Saul swore As the LORD lives he shall not be killed
Then Jonathan called David and Jonathan told him all these things
So Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was in his presence as in mes past
And there was war again and David went out and fought with the Philis nes and struck them with a mighty blow and they fled from him
Now the distressing spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand
And David was playing music with his hand
Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear but he slipped away from Saul s presence and he drove the spear into the wall
So David fled and escaped that night
Saul also sent messengers to David s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning
And Michal David s wife told him saying If you do not save your life tonight tomorrow you will be killed
So Michal let David down through a window
And he went and fled and escaped
And Michal took an image and laid it in the bed put a cover of goats hair for his head and covered it with clothes
So when Saul sent messengers to take David she said He is sick
Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David saying Bring him up to me in the bed that I may kill him
And when the messengers had come in there was the image in the bed with a cover of goats hair for his head
Then Saul said to Michal Why have you deceived me like this and sent my enemy away so that he has escaped And Michal answered Saul He said to me Let me go Why should I kill you So David fled and escaped and went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him
And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth
Now it was told Saul saying Take note David is at Naioth in Ramah Then Saul sent messengers to take David
And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as leader over them the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul and they also prophesied
And when Saul was told he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise
Then Saul sent messengers again the third me and they prophesied also
Then he also went to Ramah and came to the great well that is at Sechu
So he asked and said Where are Samuel and David And someone said Indeed they are at Naioth in Ramah
So he went there to Naioth in Ramah
Then the Spirit of God was upon him also and he went on and prophesied un l he came to Naioth in Ramah
And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night
Therefore they say Is Saul also among the prophets Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and went and said to Jonathan What have I done What is my iniquity and what is my sin before your father that he seeks my life So Jonathan said to him By no means You shall not die Indeed my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me
And why should my father hide this thing from me It is not so Then David took an oath again and said Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes and he has said Do not let Jonathan know this lest he be grieved
But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives there is but a step between me and death
So Jonathan said to David Whatever you yourself desire I will do it for you
And David said to Jonathan Indeed tomorrow is the New Moon and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat
But let me go that I may hide in the field un l the third day at evening
If your father misses me at all then say David earnestly asked permission of me that he might run over to Bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family
If he says thus It is well your servant will be safe
But if he is very angry then be sure that evil is determined by him
Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you
Nevertheless if there is iniquity in me kill me yourself for why should you bring me to your father But Jonathan said Far be it from you For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you then would I not tell you Then David said to Jonathan Who will tell me or what if your father answers you roughly And Jonathan said to David Come and let us go out into the field
So both of them went out into the field
Then Jonathan said to David The LORD God of Israel is witness When I have sounded out my father some me tomorrow or the third day and indeed there is good toward David and I do not send to you and tell you may the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan
But if it pleases my father to do you evil then I will report it to you and send you away that you may go in safety
And the LORD be with you as He has been with my father
And you shall not only show me the kindness of the LORD while I s ll live that I may not die but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever no not when the LORD has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth
So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying Let the LORD require it at the hand of David s enemies
Now Jonathan again caused David to vow because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul
Then Jonathan said to David Tomorrow is the New Moon and you will be missed because your seat will be empty
And when you have stayed three days go down quickly and come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed and remain by the stone Ezel
Then I will shoot three arrows to the side as though I shot at a target and there I will send a lad saying Go find the arrows
If I expressly say to him Look the arrows are on this side of you get them and come then as the LORD lives there is safety for you and no harm
But if I say thus to the young man Look the arrows are beyond you go your way for the LORD has sent you away
And as for the ma er which you and I have spoken of indeed the LORD be between you and me forever
Then David hid in the field
And when the New Moon had come the king sat down to eat the feast
Now the king sat on his seat as at other mes on a seat by the wall
And Jonathan arose and Abner sat by Saul s side but David s place was empty
Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day for he thought Something has happened to him he is unclean surely he is unclean
And it happened the next day the second day of the month that David s place was empty
And Saul said to Jonathan his son Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat either yesterday or today So Jonathan answered Saul David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem
And he said Please let me go for our family has a sacrifice in the city and my brother has commanded me to be there
And now if I have found favor in your eyes please let me get away and see my brothers
Therefore he has not come to the king s table
Then Saul s anger was aroused against Jonathan and he said to him You son of a perverse rebellious woman Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother s nakedness For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth you shall not be established nor your kingdom
Now therefore send and bring him to me for he shall surely die
And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him Why should he be killed What has he done Then Saul cast a spear at him to kill him by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David
So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month for he was grieved for David because his father had treated him shamefully
And so it was in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field at the me appointed with David and a li le lad was with him
Then he said to his lad Now run find the arrows which I shoot
As the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him
When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot Jonathan cried out a er the lad and said Is not the arrow beyond you And Jonathan cried out a er the lad Make haste hurry do not delay So Jonathan s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master
But the lad did not know anything
Only Jonathan and David knew of the ma er
Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him Go carry them to the city
As soon as the lad had gone David arose from a place toward the south fell on his face to the ground and bowed down three mes
And they kissed one another and they wept together but David more so
Then Jonathan said to David Go in peace since we have both sworn in the name of the LORD saying May the LORD be between you and me and between your descendants and my descendants forever
So he arose and departed and Jonathan went into the city
Now David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest
And Ahimelech was afraid when he met David and said to him Why are you alone and no one is with you So David said to Ahimelech the priest The king has ordered me on some business and said to me Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you or what I have commanded you
And I have directed my young men to such and such a place
Now therefore what have you on hand Give me five loaves of bread in my hand or whatever can be found
And the priest answered David and said There is no common bread on hand but there is holy bread if the young men have at least kept themselves from women
Then David answered the priest and said to him Truly women have been kept from us about three days since I came out
And the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in effect common even though it was sanc fied in the vessel this day
So the priest gave him holy bread for there was no bread there but the showbread which had been taken from before the LORD in order to put hot bread in its place on the day when it was taken away
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day detained before the LORD
And his name was Doeg an Edomite the chief of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul
And David said to Ahimelech Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me because the king s business required haste
So the priest said The sword of Goliath the Philis ne whom you killed in the Valley of Elah there it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod
If you will take that take it
For there is no other except that one here
And David said There is none like it give it to me
Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath
And the servants of Achish said to him Is this not David the king of the land Did they not sing of him to one another in dances saying Saul has slain his thousands And David his ten thousands Now David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath
So he changed his behavior before them feigned madness in their hands scratched on the doors of the gate and let his saliva fall down on his beard
Then Achish said to his servants Look you see the man is insane
Why have you brought him to me Have I need of madmen that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence Shall this fellow come into my house David therefore departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam
And when his brothers and all his father s house heard it they went down there to him
And everyone who was in distress everyone who was in debt and everyone who was discontented gathered to him
So he became captain over them
And there were about four hundred men with him
Then David went from there to Mizpah of Moab and he said to the king of Moab Please let my father and mother come here with you ll I know what God will do for me
So he brought them before the king of Moab and they dwelt with him all the me that David was in the stronghold
Now the prophet Gad said to David Do not stay in the stronghold depart and go to the land of Judah
So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth
When Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered now Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah with his spear in his hand and all his servants standing about him then Saul said to his servants who stood about him Hear now you Benjamites Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds All of you have conspired against me and there is no one who reveals to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse and there is not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has s rred up my servant against me to lie in wait as it is this day
Then answered Doeg the Edomite who was set over the servants of Saul and said I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub
And he inquired of the LORD for him gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philis ne
So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest the son of Ahitub and all his father s house the priests who were in Nob
And they all came to the king
And Saul said Hear now son of Ahitub And he answered Here I am my lord
Then Saul said to him Why have you conspired against me you and the son of Jesse in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as it is this day So Ahimelech answered the king and said And who among all your servants is as faithful as David who is the king s son in law who goes at your bidding and is honorable in your house Did I then begin to inquire of God for him Far be it from me Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to any in the house of my father
For your servant knew nothing of all this li le or much
And the king said You shall surely die Ahimelech you and all your father s house Then the king said to the guards who stood about him Turn and kill the priests of the LORD because their hand also is with David and because they knew when he fled and did not tell it to me
But the servants of the king would not li their hands to strike the priests of the LORD
And the king said to Doeg You turn and kill the priests So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests and killed on that day eighty five men who wore a linen ephod
Also Nob the city of the priests he struck with the edge of the sword both men and women children and nursing infants oxen and donkeys and sheep with the edge of the sword
Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub named Abiathar escaped and fled a er David
And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the LORD S priests
So David said to Abiathar I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would surely tell Saul
I have caused the death of all the persons of your father s house
Stay with me do not fear
For he who seeks my life seeks your life but with me you shall be safe
Then they told David saying Look the Philis nes are figh ng against Keilah and they are robbing the threshing floors
Therefore David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I go and a ack these Philis nes And the LORD said to David Go and a ack the Philis nes and save Keilah
But David s men said to him Look we are afraid here in Judah
How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philis nes Then David inquired of the LORD once again
And the LORD answered him and said Arise go down to Keilah
For I will deliver the Philis nes into your hand
And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philis nes struck them with a mighty blow and took away their livestock
So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah
Now it happened when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah that he went down with an ephod in his hand
And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah
So Saul said God has delivered him into my hand for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars
Then Saul called all the people together for war to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men
When David knew that Saul plo ed evil against him he said to Abiathar the priest Bring the ephod here
Then David said O LORD God of Israel Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake
Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand Will Saul come down as Your servant has heard O LORD God of Israel I pray tell Your servant
And the LORD said He will come down
Then David said Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul And the LORD said They will deliver you
So David and his men about six hundred arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go
Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah so he halted the expedi on
And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness and remained in the mountains in the Wilderness of Ziph
Saul sought him every day but God did not deliver him into his hand
So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life
And David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in a forest
Then Jonathan Saul s son arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God
And he said to him Do not fear for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you
You shall be king over Israel and I shall be next to you
Even my father Saul knows that
So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD
And David stayed in the woods and Jonathan went to his own house
Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah saying Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the woods in the hill of Hachilah which is on the south of Jeshimon Now therefore O king come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the king s hand
And Saul said Blessed are you of the LORD for you have compassion on me
Please go and find out for sure and see the place where his hideout is and who has seen him there
For I am told he is very cra y
See therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides and come back to me with certainty and I will go with you
And it shall be if he is in the land that I will search for him throughout all the clans of Judah
So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul
But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the plain on the south of Jeshimon
When Saul and his men went to seek him they told David
Therefore he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon
And when Saul heard that he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon
Then Saul went on one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain
So David made haste to get away from Saul for Saul and his men were encircling David and his men to take them
But a messenger came to Saul saying Hasten and come for the Philis nes have invaded the land Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David and went against the Philis nes so they called that place the Rock of Escape
Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at En Gedi
Now it happened when Saul had returned from following the Philis nes that it was told him saying Take note David is in the Wilderness of En Gedi
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats
So he came to the sheepfolds by the road where there was a cave and Saul went in to a end to his needs
David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave
Then the men of David said to him This is the day of which the LORD said to you Behold I will deliver your enemy into your hand that you may do to him as it seems good to you
And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul s robe
Now it happened a erward that David s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul s robe
And he said to his men The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master the LORD S anointed to stretch out my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the LORD
So David restrained his servants with these words and did not allow them to rise against Saul
And Saul got up from the cave and went on his way
David also arose a erward went out of the cave and called out to Saul saying My lord the king And when Saul looked behind him David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed down
And David said to Saul Why do you listen to the words of men who say Indeed David seeks your harm Look this day your eyes have seen that the LORD delivered you today into my hand in the cave and someone urged me to kill you
But my eye spared you and I said I will not stretch out my hand against my lord for he is the LORD S anointed
Moreover my father see Yes see the corner of your robe in my hand For in that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you know and see that there is neither evil nor rebellion in my hand and I have not sinned against you
Yet you hunt my life to take it
Let the LORD judge between you and me and let the LORD avenge me on you
But my hand shall not be against you
As the proverb of the ancients says Wickedness proceeds from the wicked
But my hand shall not be against you
A er whom has the king of Israel come out Whom do you pursue A dead dog A flea Therefore let the LORD be judge and judge between you and me and see and plead my case and deliver me out of your hand
So it was when David had finished speaking these words to Saul that Saul said Is this your voice my son David And Saul li ed up his voice and wept
Then he said to David You are more righteous than I for you have rewarded me with good whereas I have rewarded you with evil
And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me for when the LORD delivered me into your hand you did not kill me
For if a man finds his enemy will he let him get away safely Therefore may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day
And now I know indeed that you shall surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand
Therefore swear now to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants a er me and that you will not destroy my name from my father s house
So David swore to Saul
And Saul went home but David and his men went up to the stronghold
Then Samuel died and the Israelites gathered together and lamented for him and buried him at his home in Ramah
And David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Paran
Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel and the man was very rich
He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats
And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel
The name of the man was Nabal and the name of his wife Abigail
And she was a woman of good understanding and beau ful appearance but the man was harsh and evil in his doings
And he was of the house of Caleb
When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep David sent ten young men and David said to the young men Go up to Carmel go to Nabal and greet him in my name
And thus you shall say to him who lives in prosperity Peace be to you peace to your house and peace to all that you have Now I have heard that you have shearers
Your shepherds were with us and we did not hurt them nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel
Ask your young men and they will tell you
Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes for we come on a feast day
Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David
So when David s young men came they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David and waited
Then Nabal answered David s servants and said Who is David and who is the son of Jesse There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master
Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men when I do not know where they are from So David s young men turned on their heels and went back and they came and told him all these words
Then David said to his men Every man gird on his sword
So every man girded on his sword and David also girded on his sword
And about four hundred men went with David and two hundred stayed with the supplies
Now one of the young men told Abigail Nabal s wife saying Look David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master and he reviled them
But the men were very good to us and we were not hurt nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them when we were in the fields
They were a wall to us both by night and day all the me we were with them keeping the sheep
Now therefore know and consider what you will do for harm is determined against our master and against all his household
For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him
Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves of bread two skins of wine five sheep already dressed five seahs of roasted grain one hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and loaded them on donkeys
And she said to her servants Go on before me see I am coming a er you
But she did not tell her husband Nabal
So it was as she rode on the donkey that she went down under cover of the hill and there were David and his men coming down toward her and she met them
Now David had said Surely in vain I have protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that belongs to him
And he has repaid me evil for good
May God do so and more also to the enemies of David if I leave one male of all who belong to him by morning light
Now when Abigail saw David she hastened to dismount from the donkey fell on her face before David and bowed down to the ground
So she fell at his feet and said On me my lord on me let this iniquity be And please let your maidservant speak in your ears and hear the words of your maidservant
Please let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal
For as his name is so is he Nabal is his name and folly is with him
But I your maidservant did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent
Now therefore my lord as the LORD lives and as your soul lives since the LORD has held you back from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand now then let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal
And now this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord let it be given to the young men who follow my lord
Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant
For the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house because my lord fights the ba les of the LORD and evil is not found in you throughout your days
Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out as from the pocket of a sling
And it shall come to pass when the LORD has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you and has appointed you ruler over Israel that this will be no grief to you nor offense of heart to my lord either that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has avenged himself
But when the LORD has dealt well with my lord then remember your maidservant
Then David said to Abigail Blessed is the LORD God of Israel who sent you this day to meet me And blessed is your advice and blessed are you because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand
For indeed as the LORD God of Israel lives who has kept me back from hur ng you unless you had hastened and come to meet me surely by morning light no males would have been le to Nabal So David received from her hand what she had brought him and said to her Go up in peace to your house
See I have heeded your voice and respected your person
Now Abigail went to Nabal and there he was holding a feast in his house like the feast of a king
And Nabal s heart was merry within him for he was very drunk therefore she told him nothing li le or much un l morning light
So it was in the morning when the wine had gone from Nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became like a stone
Then it came about a er about ten days that the LORD struck Nabal and he died
So when David heard that Nabal was dead he said Blessed be the LORD who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept His servant from evil For the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head
And David sent and proposed to Abigail to take her as his wife
When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel they spoke to her saying David sent us to you to ask you to become his wife
Then she arose bowed her face to the earth and said Here is your maidservant a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord
So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey a ended by five of her maidens and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel and so both of them were his wives
But Saul had given Michal his daughter David s wife to Pal the son of Laish who was from Gallim
Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah saying Is David not hiding in the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph
And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah which is opposite Jeshimon by the road
But David stayed in the wilderness and he saw that Saul came a er him into the wilderness
David therefore sent out spies and understood that Saul had indeed come
So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped
And David saw the place where Saul lay and Abner the son of Ner the commander of his army
Now Saul lay within the camp with the people encamped all around him
Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hi te and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah brother of Joab saying Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp And Abishai said I will go down with you
So David and Abishai came to the people by night and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp with his spear stuck in the ground by his head
And Abner and the people lay all around him
Then Abishai said to David God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day
Now therefore please let me strike him at once with the spear right to the earth and I will not have to strike him a second me And David said to Abishai Do not destroy him for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD S anointed and be guiltless David said furthermore As the LORD lives the LORD shall strike him or his day shall come to die or he shall go out to ba le and perish
The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD S anointed
But please take now the spear and the jug of water that are by his head and let us go
So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul s head and they got away and no man saw it or knew it or awoke
For they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them
Now David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a hill afar off a great distance being between them
And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner saying Do you not answer Abner Then Abner answered and said Who are you calling out to the king So David said to Abner Are you not a man And who is like you in Israel Why then have you not guarded your lord the king For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king
This thing that you have done is not good
As the LORD lives you deserve to die because you have not guarded your master the LORD S anointed
And now see where the king s spear is and the jug of water that was by his head
Then Saul knew David s voice and said Is that your voice my son David And David said It is my voice my lord O king
And he said Why does my lord thus pursue his servant For what have I done or what evil is in my hand Now therefore please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant If the LORD has s rred you up against me let Him accept an offering
But if it is the children of men may they be cursed before the LORD for they have driven me out this day from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD saying Go serve other gods
So now do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD
For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains
Then Saul said I have sinned
Return my son David
For I will harm you no more because my life was precious in your eyes this day
Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly
And David answered and said Here is the king s spear
Let one of the young men come over and get it
May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness for the LORD delivered you into my hand today but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD S anointed
And indeed as your life was valued much this day in my eyes so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the LORD and let Him deliver me out of all tribula on
Then Saul said to David May you be blessed my son David You shall both do great things and also s ll prevail
So David went on his way and Saul returned to his place
And David said in his heart Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul
There is nothing be er for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philis nes and Saul will despair of me to seek me anymore in any part of Israel
So I shall escape out of his hand
Then David arose and went over with the six hundred men who were with him to Achish the son of Maoch king of Gath
So David dwelt with Achish at Gath he and his men each man with his household and David with his two wives Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess Nabal s widow
And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath so he sought him no more
Then David said to Achish If I have now found favor in your eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that I may dwell there
For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you So Achish gave him Ziklag that day
Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day
Now the me that David dwelt in the country of the Philis nes was one full year and four months
And David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites the Girzites and the Amalekites
For those na ons were the inhabitants of the land from of old as you go to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt
Whenever David a acked the land he le neither man nor woman alive but took away the sheep the oxen the donkeys the camels and the apparel and returned and came to Achish
Then Achish would say Where have you made a raid today And David would say Against the southern area of Judah or against the southern area of the Jerahmeelites or against the southern area of the Kenites
David would save neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath saying Lest they should inform on us saying Thus David did
And thus was his behavior all the me he dwelt in the country of the Philis nes
So Achish believed David saying He has made his people Israel u erly abhor him therefore he will be my servant forever
Now it happened in those days that the Philis nes gathered their armies together for war to fight with Israel
And Achish said to David You assuredly know that you will go out with me to ba le you and your men
And David said to Achish Surely you know what your servant can do
And Achish said to David Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever
Now Samuel had died and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah in his own city
And Saul had put the mediums and the spiri sts out of the land
Then the Philis nes gathered together and came and encamped at Shunem
So Saul gathered all Israel together and they encamped at Gilboa
When Saul saw the army of the Philis nes he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly
And when Saul inquired of the LORD the LORD did not answer him either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets
Then Saul said to his servants Find me a woman who is a medium that I may go to her and inquire of her
And his servants said to him In fact there is a woman who is a medium at En Dor
So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night
And he said Please conduct a seance for me and bring up for me the one I shall name to you
Then the woman said to him Look you know what Saul has done how he has cut off the mediums and the spiri sts from the land
Why then do you lay a snare for my life to cause me to die And Saul swore to her by the LORD saying As the LORD lives no punishment shall come upon you for this thing
Then the woman said Whom shall I bring up for you And he said Bring up Samuel for me
When the woman saw Samuel she cried out with a loud voice
And the woman spoke to Saul saying Why have you deceived me For you are Saul And the king said to her Do not be afraid
What did you see And the woman said to Saul I saw a spirit ascending out of the earth
So he said to her What is his form And she said An old man is coming up and he is covered with a mantle
And Saul perceived that it was Samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed down
Now Samuel said to Saul Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up And Saul answered I am deeply distressed for the Philis nes make war against me and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore neither by prophets nor by dreams
Therefore I have called you that you may reveal to me what I should do
Then Samuel said Why then do you ask me seeing the LORD has departed from you and has become your enemy And the LORD has done for Himself as He spoke by me
For the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David
Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD nor execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day
Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philis nes
And tomorrow you and your sons will be with me
The LORD will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philis nes
Then immediately Saul fell full length on the ground and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel
And there was no strength in him for he had eaten no food all day or all night
And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled and said to him Look your maidservant has obeyed your voice and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me
Now therefore please heed also the voice of your maidservant and let me set a piece of bread before you and eat that you may have strength when you go on your way
But he refused and said I will not eat
So his servants together with the woman urged him and he heeded their voice
Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed
Now the woman had a fa ed calf in the house and she hastened to kill it
And she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it
So she brought it before Saul and his servants and they ate
Then they rose and went away that night
Then the Philis nes gathered together all their armies at Aphek and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel
And the lords of the Philis nes passed in review by hundreds and by thousands but David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish
Then the princes of the Philis nes said What are these Hebrews doing here And Achish said to the princes of the Philis nes Is this not David the servant of Saul king of Israel who has been with me these days or these years And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected to me
But the princes of the Philis nes were angry with him so the princes of the Philis nes said to him Make this fellow return that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him and do not let him go down with us to ba le lest in the ba le he become our adversary
For with what could he reconcile himself to his master if not with the heads of these men Is this not David of whom they sang to one another in dances saying Saul has slain his thousands And David his ten thousands Then Achish called David and said to him Surely as the LORD lives you have been upright and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight
For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me
Nevertheless the lords do not favor you
Therefore return now and go in peace that you may not displease the lords of the Philis nes
So David said to Achish But what have I done And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king Then Achish answered and said to David I know that you are as good in my sight as an angel of God nevertheless the princes of the Philis nes have said He shall not go up with us to the ba le
Now therefore rise early in the morning with your master s servants who have come with you
And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light depart
So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philis nes
And the Philis nes went up to Jezreel
Now it happened when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag a acked Ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken cap ve the women and those who were there from small to great they did not kill anyone but carried them away and went their way
So David and his men came to the city and there it was burned with fire and their wives their sons and their daughters had been taken cap ve
Then David and the people who were with him li ed up their voices and wept un l they had no more power to weep
And David s two wives Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite had been taken cap ve
Now David was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and his daughters
But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God
Then David said to Abiathar the priest Ahimelech s son Please bring the ephod here to me
And Abiathar brought the ephod to David
So David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I pursue this troop Shall I overtake them And He answered him Pursue for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all
So David went he and the six hundred men who were with him and came to the Brook Besor where those stayed who were le behind
But David pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred stayed behind who were so weary that they could not cross the Brook Besor
Then they found an Egyp an in the field and brought him to David and they gave him bread and he ate and they let him drink water
And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins
So when he had eaten his strength came back to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights
Then David said to him To whom do you belong and where are you from And he said I am a young man from Egypt servant of an Amalekite and my master le me behind because three days ago I fell sick
We made an invasion of the southern area of the Cherethites in the territory which belongs to Judah and of the southern area of Caleb and we burned Ziklag with fire
And David said to him Can you take me down to this troop So he said Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and I will take you down to this troop
And when he had brought him down there they were spread out over all the land ea ng and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philis nes and from the land of Judah
Then David a acked them from twilight un l the evening of the next day
Not a man of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled
So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away and David rescued his two wives
And nothing of theirs was lacking either small or great sons or daughters spoil or anything which they had taken from them David recovered all
Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock and said This is David s spoil
Now David came to the two hundred men who had been so weary that they could not follow David whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor
So they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him
And when David came near the people he greeted them
Then all the wicked and worthless men of those who went with David answered and said Because they did not go with us we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered except for every man s wife and children that they may lead them away and depart
But David said My brethren you shall not do so with what the LORD has given us who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us
For who will heed you in this ma er But as his part is who goes down to the ba le so shall his part be who stays by the supplies they shall share alike
So it was from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day
Now when David came to Ziklag he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah to his friends saying Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD to those who were in Bethel those who were in Ramoth of the South those who were in Ja r those who were in Aroer those who were in Siphmoth those who were in Eshtemoa those who were in Rachal those who were in the ci es of the Jerahmeelites those who were in the ci es of the Kenites those who were in Hormah those who were in Chorashan those who were in Athach those who were in Hebron and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to rove
Now the Philis nes fought against Israel and the men of Israel fled from before the Philis nes and fell slain on Mount Gilboa
Then the Philis nes followed hard a er Saul and his sons
And the Philis nes killed Jonathan Abinadab and Malchishua Saul s sons
The ba le became fierce against Saul
The archers hit him and he was severely wounded by the archers
Then Saul said to his armorbearer Draw your sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me
But his armorbearer would not for he was greatly afraid
Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it
And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead he also fell on his sword and died with him
So Saul his three sons his armorbearer and all his men died together that same day
And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those who were on the other side of the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead they forsook the ci es and fled and the Philis nes came and dwelt in them
So it happened the next day when the Philis nes came to strip the slain that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa
And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent word throughout the land of the Philis nes to proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people
Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan
Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philis nes had done to Saul all the valiant men arose and traveled all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and they came to Jabesh and burned them there
Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh and fasted seven days
Samuel Now it came to pass a er the death of Saul when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and David had stayed two days in Ziklag on the third day behold it happened that a man came from Saul s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head
So it was when he came to David that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself
And David said to him Where have you come from So he said to him I have escaped from the camp of Israel
Then David said to him How did the ma er go Please tell me
And he answered The people have fled from the ba le many of the people are fallen and dead and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also
So David said to the young man who told him How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead Then the young man who told him said As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa there was Saul leaning on his spear and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard a er him
Now when he looked behind him he saw me and called to me
And I answered Here I am
And he said to me Who are you So I answered him I am an Amalekite
He said to me again Please stand over me and kill me for anguish has come upon me but my life s ll remains in me
So I stood over him and killed him because I was sure that he could not live a er he had fallen
And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them here to my lord
Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them and so did all the men who were with him
And they mourned and wept and fasted un l evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword
Then David said to the young man who told him Where are you from And he answered I am the son of an alien an Amalekite
So David said to him How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the LORD S anointed Then David called one of the young men and said Go near and execute him And he struck him so that he died
So David said to him Your blood is on your own head for your own mouth has tes fied against you saying I have killed the LORD S anointed
Then David lamented with this lamenta on over Saul and over Jonathan his son and he told them to teach the children of Judah the Song of the Bow indeed it is wri en in the Book of Jasher The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places How the mighty have fallen Tell it not in Gath Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon Lest the daughters of the Philis nes rejoice Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph
O mountains of Gilboa Let there be no dew nor rain upon you Nor fields of offerings
For the shield of the mighty is cast away there The shield of Saul not anointed with oil
From the blood of the slain From the fat of the mighty The bow of Jonathan did not turn back And the sword of Saul did not return empty
Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives And in their death they were not divided They were swi er than eagles They were stronger than lions
O daughters of Israel weep over Saul Who clothed you in scarlet with luxury Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel
How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the ba le Jonathan was slain in your high places
I am distressed for you my brother Jonathan You have been very pleasant to me Your love to me was wonderful Surpassing the love of women
How the mighty have fallen And the weapons of war perished It happened a er this that David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I go up to any of the ci es of Judah And the LORD said to him Go up
David said Where shall I go up And He said To Hebron
So David went up there and his two wives also Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite
And David brought up the men who were with him every man with his household
So they dwelt in the ci es of Hebron
Then the men of Judah came and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah
And they told David saying The men of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul
So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead and said to them You are blessed of the LORD for you have shown this kindness to your lord to Saul and have buried him
And now may the LORD show kindness and truth to you
I also will repay you this kindness because you have done this thing
Now therefore let your hands be strengthened and be valiant for your master Saul is dead and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them
But Abner the son of Ner commander of Saul s army took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim and he made him king over Gilead over the Ashurites over Jezreel over Ephraim over Benjamin and over all Israel
Ishbosheth Saul s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel and he reigned two years
Only the house of Judah followed David
And the me that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months
Now Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon
And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon
So they sat down one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool
Then Abner said to Joab Let the young men now arise and compete before us
And Joab said Let them arise
So they arose and went over by number twelve from Benjamin followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul and twelve from the servants of David
And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent s side so they fell down together
Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords which is in Gibeon
So there was a very fierce ba le that day and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David
Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there Joab and Abishai and Asahel
And Asahel was as fleet of foot as a wild gazelle
So Asahel pursued Abner and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the le from following Abner
Then Abner looked behind him and said Are you Asahel He answered I am
And Abner said to him Turn aside to your right hand or to your le and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself
But Asahel would not turn aside from following him
So Abner said again to Asahel Turn aside from following me
Why should I strike you to the ground How then could I face your brother Joab However he refused to turn aside
Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear so that the spear came out of his back and he fell down there and died on the spot
So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood s ll
Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner
And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah which is before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon
Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit and took their stand on top of a hill
Then Abner called to Joab and said Shall the sword devour forever Do you not know that it will be bi er in the la er end How long will it be then un l you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren And Joab said As God lives unless you had spoken surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren
So Joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood s ll and did not pursue Israel anymore nor did they fight anymore
Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain crossed over the Jordan and went through all Bithron and they came to Mahanaim
So Joab returned from pursuing Abner
And when he had gathered all the people together there were missing of David s servants nineteen men and Asahel
But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin and Abner s men three hundred and sixty men who died
Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father s tomb which was in Bethlehem
And Joab and his men went all night and they came to Hebron at daybreak
Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David
But David grew stronger and stronger and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker
Sons were born to David in Hebron His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess his second Chileab by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite the third Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur the fourth Adonijah the son of Haggith the fi h Shepha ah the son of Abital and the sixth Ithream by David s wife Eglah
These were born to David in Hebron
Now it was so while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner was strengthening his hold on the house of Saul
And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah
So Ishbosheth said to Abner Why have you gone in to my father s concubine Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and said Am I a dog s head that belongs to Judah Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father to his brothers and to his friends and have not delivered you into the hand of David and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman May God do so to Abner and more also if I do not do for David as the LORD has sworn to him to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beersheba
And he could not answer Abner another word because he feared him
Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David saying Whose is the land saying also Make your covenant with me and indeed my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel to you
And David said Good I will make a covenant with you
But one thing I require of you you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal Saul s daughter when you come to see my face
So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul s son saying Give me my wife Michal whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philis nes
And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband from Pal el the son of Laish
Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim weeping behind her
So Abner said to him Go return And he returned
Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel saying In me past you were seeking for David to be king over you
Now then do it For the LORD has spoken of David saying By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philis nes and the hand of all their enemies
And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin
Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin
So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron
And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him
Then Abner said to David I will arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king that they may make a covenant with you and that you may reign over all that your heart desires
So David sent Abner away and he went in peace
At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them
But Abner was not with David in Hebron for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace
When Joab and all the troops that were with him had come they told Joab saying Abner the son of Ner came to the king and he sent him away and he has gone in peace
Then Joab came to the king and said What have you done Look Abner came to you why is it that you sent him away and he has already gone Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you to know your going out and your coming in and to know all that you are doing
And when Joab had gone from David s presence he sent messengers a er Abner who brought him back from the well of Sirah
But David did not know it
Now when Abner had returned to Hebron Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately and there stabbed him in the stomach so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother
A erward when David heard it he said My kingdom and I are guiltless before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner
Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father s house and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper who leans on a staff or falls by the sword or who lacks bread
So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the ba le
Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him Tear your clothes gird yourselves with sackcloth and mourn for Abner
And King David followed the coffin
So they buried Abner in Hebron and the king li ed up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people wept
And the king sang a lament over Abner and said Should Abner die as a fool dies Your hands were not bound Nor your feet put into fe ers As a man falls before wicked men so you fell
Then all the people wept over him again
And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was s ll day David took an oath saying God do so to me and more also if I taste bread or anything else ll the sun goes down Now all the people took note of it and it pleased them since whatever the king did pleased all the people
For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner
Then the king said to his servants Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel And I am weak today though anointed king and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too harsh for me
The LORD shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness
When Saul s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron he lost heart and all Israel was troubled
Now Saul s son had two men who were captains of troops
The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the children of Benjamin
For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin because the Beerothites fled to Gi aim and have been sojourners there un l this day
Jonathan Saul s son had a son who was lame in his feet
He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled
And it happened as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame
His name was Mephibosheth
Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite Rechab and Baanah set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth who was lying on his bed at noon
And they came there all the way into the house as though to get wheat and they stabbed him in the stomach
Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped
For when they came into the house he was lying on his bed in his bedroom then they struck him and killed him beheaded him and took his head and were all night escaping through the plain
And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king Here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul your enemy who sought your life and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants
But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite and said to them As the LORD lives who has redeemed my life from all adversity when someone told me saying Look Saul is dead thinking to have brought good news I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news
How much more when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed Therefore shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth So David commanded his young men and they executed them cut off their hands and feet and hanged them by the pool in Hebron
But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron
Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke saying Indeed we are your bone and your flesh
Also in me past when Saul was king over us you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in and the LORD said to you You shall shepherd My people Israel and be ruler over Israel
Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD
And they anointed David king over Israel
David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty three years over all Israel and Judah
And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land who spoke to David saying You shall not come in here but the blind and the lame will repel you thinking David cannot come in here
Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion that is the City of David
Now David said on that day Whoever climbs up by way of the water sha and defeats the Jebusites the lame and the blind who are hated by David s soul he shall be chief and captain
Therefore they say The blind and the lame shall not come into the house
Then David dwelt in the stronghold and called it the City of David
And David built all around from the Millo and inward
So David went on and became great and the LORD God of hosts was with him
Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David and cedar trees and carpenters and masons
And they built David a house
So David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and that He had exalted His kingdom for the sake of His people Israel
And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem a er he had come from Hebron
Also more sons and daughters were born to David
Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem Shammua Shobab Nathan Solomon Ibhar Elishua Nepheg Japhia Elishama Eliada and Eliphelet
Now when the Philis nes heard that they had anointed David king over Israel all the Philis nes went up to search for David
And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold
The Philis nes also went and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim
So David inquired of the LORD saying Shall I go up against the Philis nes Will You deliver them into my hand And the LORD said to David Go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philis nes into your hand
So David went to Baal Perazim and David defeated them there and he said The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a breakthrough of water
Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim
And they le their images there and David and his men carried them away
Then the Philis nes went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim
Therefore David inquired of the LORD and He said You shall not go up circle around behind them and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees
And it shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees then you shall advance quickly
For then the LORD will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philis nes
And David did so as the LORD commanded him and he drove back the Philis nes from Geba as far as Gezer
Again David gathered all the choice men of Israel thirty thousand
And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God whose name is called by the Name the LORD of Hosts who dwells between the cherubim
So they set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill and Uzzah and Ahio the sons of Abinadab drove the new cart
And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill accompanying the ark of God and Ahio went before the ark
Then David and all the house of Israel played music before the LORD on all kinds of instruments of fir wood on harps on stringed instruments on tambourines on sistrums and on cymbals
And when they came to Nachon s threshing floor Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it for the oxen stumbled
Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzzah and God struck him there for his error and he died there by the ark of God
And David became angry because of the LORD S outbreak against Uzzah and he called the name of the place Perez Uzzah to this day
David was afraid of the LORD that day and he said How can the ark of the LORD come to me So David would not move the ark of the LORD with him into the City of David but David took it aside into the house of Obed Edom the Gi te
The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed Edom the Gi te three months
And the LORD blessed Obed Edom and all his household
Now it was told King David saying The LORD has blessed the house of Obed Edom and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed Edom to the City of David with gladness
And so it was when those bearing the ark of the LORD had gone six paces that he sacrificed oxen and fa ed sheep
Then David danced before the LORD with all his might and David was wearing a linen ephod
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shou ng and with the sound of the trumpet
Now as the ark of the LORD came into the City of David Michal Saul s daughter looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before the LORD and she despised him in her heart
So they brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it
Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD
And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts
Then he distributed among all the people among the whole mul tude of Israel both the women and the men to everyone a loaf of bread a piece of meat and a cake of raisins
So all the people departed everyone to his house
Then David returned to bless his household
And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said How glorious was the king of Israel today uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself So David said to Michal It was before the LORD who chose me instead of your father and all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD over Israel
Therefore I will play music before the LORD
And I will be even more undignified than this and will be humble in my own sight
But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken by them I will be held in honor
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death
Now it came to pass when the king was dwelling in his house and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies all around that the king said to Nathan the prophet See now I dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of God dwells inside tent curtains
Then Nathan said to the king Go do all that is in your heart for the LORD is with you
But it happened that night that the word of the LORD came to Nathan saying Go and tell My servant David Thus says the LORD Would you build a house for Me to dwell in For I have not dwelt in a house since the me that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt even to this day but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle
Wherever I have moved about with all the children of Israel have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel saying Why have you not built Me a house of cedar Now therefore thus shall you say to My servant David Thus says the LORD of hosts I took you from the sheepfold from following the sheep to be ruler over My people over Israel
And I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you and have made you a great name like the name of the great men who are on the earth
Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore as previously since the me that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel and have caused you to rest from all your enemies
Also the LORD tells you that He will make you a house
When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers I will set up your seed a er you who will come from your body and I will establish his kingdom
He shall build a house for My name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever
I will be his Father and he shall be My son
If he commits iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men
But My mercy shall not depart from him as I took it from Saul whom I removed from before you
And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you
Your throne shall be established forever
According to all these words and according to all this vision so Nathan spoke to David
Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and he said Who am I O Lord GOD And what is my house that You have brought me this far And yet this was a small thing in Your sight O Lord GOD and You have also spoken of Your servant s house for a great while to come
Is this the manner of man O Lord GOD Now what more can David say to You For You Lord GOD know Your servant
For Your word s sake and according to Your own heart You have done all these great things to make Your servant know them
Therefore You are great O LORD GOD
For there is none like You nor is there any God besides You according to all that we have heard with our ears
And who is like Your people like Israel the one na on on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people to make for Himself a name and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt the na ons and their gods For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever and You LORD have become their God
Now O LORD God the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house establish it forever and do as You have said
So let Your name be magnified forever saying The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel
And let the house of Your servant David be established before You
For You O LORD of hosts God of Israel have revealed this to Your servant saying I will build you a house
Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You
And now O Lord GOD You are God and Your words are true and You have promised this goodness to Your servant
Now therefore let it please You to bless the house of Your servant that it may con nue forever before You for You O Lord GOD have spoken it and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever
A er this it came to pass that David a acked the Philis nes and subdued them
And David took Metheg Ammah from the hand of the Philis nes
Then he defeated Moab
Forcing them down to the ground he measured them off with a line
With two lines he measured off those to be put to death and with one full line those to be kept alive
So the Moabites became David s servants and brought tribute
David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah as he went to recover his territory at the River Euphrates
David took from him one thousand chariots seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers
Also David hamstrung all the chariot horses except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots
When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah David killed twenty two thousand of the Syrians
Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus and the Syrians became David s servants and brought tribute
The LORD preserved David wherever he went
And David took the shields of gold that had belonged to the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem
Also from Betah and from Berothai ci es of Hadadezer King David took a large amount of bronze
When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer then Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi and Joram brought with him ar cles of silver ar cles of gold and ar cles of bronze
King David also dedicated these to the LORD along with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the na ons which he had subdued from Syria from Moab from the people of Ammon from the Philis nes from Amalek and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah
And David made himself a name when he returned from killing eighteen thousand Syrians in the Valley of Salt
He also put garrisons in Edom throughout all Edom he put garrisons and all the Edomites became David s servants
And the LORD preserved David wherever he went
So David reigned over all Israel and David administered judgment and jus ce to all his people
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests Seraiah was the scribe Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites and David s sons were chief ministers
Now David said Is there s ll anyone who is le of the house of Saul that I may show him kindness for Jonathan s sake And there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba
So when they had called him to David the king said to him Are you Ziba And he said At your service Then the king said Is there not s ll someone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God And Ziba said to the king There is s ll a son of Jonathan who is lame in his feet
So the king said to him Where is he And Ziba said to the king Indeed he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo Debar
Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar
Now when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul had come to David he fell on his face and prostrated himself
Then David said Mephibosheth And he answered Here is your servant So David said to him Do not fear for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father s sake and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather and you shall eat bread at my table con nually
Then he bowed himself and said What is your servant that you should look upon such a dead dog as I And the king called to Ziba Saul s servant and said to him I have given to your master s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house
You therefore and your sons and your servants shall work the land for him and you shall bring in the harvest that your master s son may have food to eat
But Mephibosheth your master s son shall eat bread at my table always
Now Ziba had fi een sons and twenty servants
Then Ziba said to the king According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant so will your servant do
As for Mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table like one of the king s sons
Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha
And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem for he ate con nually at the king s table
And he was lame in both his feet
It happened a er this that the king of the people of Ammon died and Hanun his son reigned in his place
Then David said I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash as his father showed kindness to me
So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father
And David s servants came into the land of the people of Ammon
And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their lord Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you Has David not rather sent his servants to you to search the city to spy it out and to overthrow it Therefore Hanun took David s servants shaved off half of their beards cut off their garments in the middle at their bu ocks and sent them away
When they told David he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed
And the king said Wait at Jericho un l your beards have grown and then return
When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David the people of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zoba twenty thousand foot soldiers and from the king of Maacah one thousand men and from Ish Tob twelve thousand men
Now when David heard of it he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men
Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in ba le array at the entrance of the gate
And the Syrians of Zoba Beth Rehob Ish Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field
When Joab saw that the ba le line was against him before and behind he chose some of Israel s best and put them in ba le array against the Syrians
And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother that he might set them in ba le array against the people of Ammon
Then he said If the Syrians are too strong for me then you shall help me but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you then I will come and help you
Be of good courage and let us be strong for our people and for the ci es of our God
And may the LORD do what is good in His sight
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the ba le against the Syrians and they fled before him
When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing they also fled before Abishai and entered the city
So Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went to Jerusalem
When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel they gathered together
Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River and they came to Helam
And Shobach the commander of Hadadezer s army went before them
When it was told David he gathered all Israel crossed over the Jordan and came to Helam
And the Syrians set themselves in ba le array against David and fought with him
Then the Syrians fled before Israel and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen of the Syrians and struck Shobach the commander of their army who died there
And when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel they made peace with Israel and served them
So the Syrians were afraid to help the people of Ammon anymore
It happened in the spring of the year at the me when kings go out to ba le that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the people of Ammon and besieged Rabbah
But David remained at Jerusalem
Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king s house
And from the roof he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beau ful to behold
So David sent and inquired about the woman
And someone said Is this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam the wife of Uriah the Hi te Then David sent messengers and took her and she came to him and he lay with her for she was cleansed from her impurity and she returned to her house
And the woman conceived so she sent and told David and said I am with child
Then David sent to Joab saying Send me Uriah the Hi te
And Joab sent Uriah to David
When Uriah had come to him David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war prospered
And David said to Uriah Go down to your house and wash your feet
So Uriah departed from the king s house and a gi of food from the king followed him
But Uriah slept at the door of the king s house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house
So when they told David saying Uriah did not go down to his house David said to Uriah Did you not come from a journey Why did you not go down to your house And Uriah said to David The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields
Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink and to lie with my wife As you live and as your soul lives I will not do this thing
Then David said to Uriah Wait here today also and tomorrow I will let you depart
So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next
Now when David called him he ate and drank before him and he made him drunk
And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but he did not go down to his house
In the morning it happened that David wrote a le er to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah
And he wrote in the le er saying Set Uriah in the forefront of the ho est ba le and retreat from him that he may be struck down and die
So it was while Joab besieged the city that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men
Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab
And some of the people of the servants of David fell and Uriah the Hi te died also
Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war and charged the messenger saying When you have finished telling the ma ers of the war to the king if it happens that the king s wrath rises and he says to you Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall so that he died in Thebez Why did you go near the wall then you shall say Your servant Uriah the Hi te is dead also
So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him
And the messenger said to David Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate
The archers shot from the wall at your servants and some of the king s servants are dead and your servant Uriah the Hi te is dead also
Then David said to the messenger Thus you shall say to Joab Do not let this thing displease you for the sword devours one as well as another
Strengthen your a ack against the city and overthrow it
So encourage him
When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband
And when her mourning was over David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son
But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD
Then the LORD sent Nathan to David
And he came to him and said to him There were two men in one city one rich and the other poor
The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds
But the poor man had nothing except one li le ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished and it grew up together with him and with his children
It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom and it was like a daughter to him
And a traveler came to the rich man who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him but he took the poor man s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him
So David s anger was greatly aroused against the man and he said to Nathan As the LORD lives the man who has done this shall surely die And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb because he did this thing and because he had no pity
Then Nathan said to David You are the man Thus says the LORD God of Israel I anointed you king over Israel and I delivered you from the hand of Saul
I gave you your master s house and your master s wives into your keeping and gave you the house of Israel and Judah
And if that had been too li le I also would have given you much more Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD to do evil in His sight You have killed Uriah the Hi te with the sword you have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon
Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hi te to be your wife
Thus says the LORD Behold I will raise up adversity against you from your own house and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun
For you did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel before the sun
So David said to Nathan I have sinned against the LORD
And Nathan said to David The LORD also has put away your sin you shall not die
However because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme the child also who is born to you shall surely die
Then Nathan departed to his house
And the LORD struck the child that Uriah s wife bore to David and it became ill
David therefore pleaded with God for the child and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground
So the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the ground
But he would not nor did he eat food with them
Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died
And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead
For they said Indeed while the child was alive we spoke to him and he would not heed our voice
How can we tell him that the child is dead He may do some harm When David saw that his servants were whispering David perceived that the child was dead
Therefore David said to his servants Is the child dead And they said He is dead
So David arose from the ground washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes and he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped
Then he went to his own house and when he requested they set food before him and he ate
Then his servants said to him What is this that you have done You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive but when the child died you arose and ate food
And he said While the child was alive I fasted and wept for I said Who can tell whether the LORD will be gracious to me that the child may live But now he is dead why should I fast Can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return to me
Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife and went in to her and lay with her
So she bore a son and he called his name Solomon
Now the LORD loved him and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet So he called his name Jedidiah because of the LORD
Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the people of Ammon and took the royal city
And Joab sent messengers to David and said I have fought against Rabbah and I have taken the city s water supply
Now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest I take the city and it be called a er my name
So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah fought against it and took it
Then he took their king s crown from his head
Its weight was a talent of gold with precious stones
And it was set on David s head
Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance
And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them cross over to the brick works
So he did to all the ci es of the people of Ammon
Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem
A er this Absalom the son of David had a lovely sister whose name was Tamar and Amnon the son of David loved her
Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick for she was a virgin
And it was improper for Amnon to do anything to her
But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah David s brother
Now Jonadab was a very cra y man
And he said to him Why are you the king s son becoming thinner day a er day Will you not tell me Amnon said to him I love Tamar my brother Absalom s sister
So Jonadab said to him Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill
And when your father comes to see you say to him Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food and prepare the food in my sight that I may see it and eat it from her hand
Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill and when the king came to see him Amnon said to the king Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me in my sight that I may eat from her hand
And David sent home to Tamar saying Now go to your brother Amnon s house and prepare food for him
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon s house and he was lying down
Then she took flour and kneaded it made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes
And she took the pan and placed them out before him but he refused to eat
Then Amnon said Have everyone go out from me
And they all went out from him
Then Amnon said to Tamar Bring the food into the bedroom that I may eat from your hand
And Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom
Now when she had brought them to him to eat he took hold of her and said to her Come lie with me my sister
And she answered him No my brother do not force me for no such thing should be done in Israel
Do not do this disgraceful thing And I where could I take my shame And as for you you would be like one of the fools in Israel
Now therefore please speak to the king for he will not withhold me from you
However he would not heed her voice and being stronger than she he forced her and lay with her
Then Amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her
And Amnon said to her Arise be gone So she said to him No indeed This evil of sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me
But he would not listen to her
Then he called his servant who a ended him and said Here Put this woman out away from me and bolt the door behind her
Now she had on a robe of many colors for the king s virgin daughters wore such apparel
And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her
Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe of many colors that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went away crying bi erly
And Absalom her brother said to her Has Amnon your brother been with you But now hold your peace my sister
He is your brother do not take this thing to heart
So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom s house
But when King David heard of all these things he was very angry
And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad
For Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced his sister Tamar
And it came to pass a er two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor which is near Ephraim so Absalom invited all the king s sons
Then Absalom came to the king and said Kindly note your servant has sheepshearers please let the king and his servants go with your servant
But the king said to Absalom No my son let us not all go now lest we be a burden to you
Then he urged him but he would not go and he blessed him
Then Absalom said If not please let my brother Amnon go with us
And the king said to him Why should he go with you But Absalom urged him so he let Amnon and all the king s sons go with him
Now Absalom had commanded his servants saying Watch now when Amnon s heart is merry with wine and when I say to you Strike Amnon then kill him
Do not be afraid
Have I not commanded you Be courageous and valiant
So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded
Then all the king s sons arose and each one got on his mule and fled
And it came to pass while they were on the way that news came to David saying Absalom has killed all the king s sons and not one of them is le So the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the ground and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn
Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah David s brother answered and said Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men the king s sons for only Amnon is dead
For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar
Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king s sons are dead
For only Amnon is dead
Then Absalom fled
And the young man who was keeping watch li ed his eyes and looked and there many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind him
And Jonadab said to the king Look the king s sons are coming as your servant said so it is
So it was as soon as he had finished speaking that the king s sons indeed came and they li ed up their voice and wept
Also the king and all his servants wept very bi erly
But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud king of Geshur
And David mourned for his son every day
So Absalom fled and went to Geshur and was there three years
And King David longed to go to Absalom
For he had been comforted concerning Amnon because he was dead
So Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king s heart was concerned about Absalom
And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her Please pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel do not anoint yourself with oil but act like a woman who has been mourning a long me for the dead
Go to the king and speak to him in this manner
So Joab put the words in her mouth
And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said Help O king Then the king said to her What troubles you And she answered Indeed I am a widow my husband is dead
Now your maidservant had two sons and the two fought with each other in the field and there was no one to part them but the one struck the other and killed him
And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant and they said Deliver him who struck his brother that we may execute him for the life of his brother whom he killed and we will destroy the heir also
So they would ex nguish my ember that is le and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the earth
Then the king said to the woman Go to your house and I will give orders concerning you
And the woman of Tekoa said to the king My lord O king let the iniquity be on me and on my father s house and the king and his throne be guiltless
So the king said Whoever says anything to you bring him to me and he shall not touch you anymore
Then she said Please let the king remember the LORD your God and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore lest they destroy my son
And he said As the LORD lives not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground
Therefore the woman said Please let your maidservant speak another word to my lord the king
And he said Say on
So the woman said Why then have you schemed such a thing against the people of God For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty in that the king does not bring his banished one home again
For we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again
Yet God does not take away a life but He devises means so that His banished ones are not expelled from Him
Now therefore I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid
And your maidservant said I will now speak to the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant
For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God
Your maidservant said The word of my lord the king will now be comfor ng for as the angel of God so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil
And may the LORD your God be with you
Then the king answered and said to the woman Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you
And the woman said Please let my lord the king speak
So the king said Is the hand of Joab with you in all this And the woman answered and said As you live my lord the king no one can turn to the right hand or to the le from anything that my lord the king has spoken
For your servant Joab commanded me and he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant
To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing but my lord is wise according to the wisdom of the angel of God to know everything that is in the earth
And the king said to Joab All right I have granted this thing
Go therefore bring back the young man Absalom
Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king
And Joab said Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight my lord O king in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant
So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem
And the king said Let him return to his own house but do not let him see my face
So Absalom returned to his own house but did not see the king s face
Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks
From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him
And when he cut the hair of his head at the end of every year he cut it because it was heavy on him when he cut it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king s standard
To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar
She was a woman of beau ful appearance
And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem but did not see the king s face
Therefore Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him
And when he sent again the second me he would not come
So he said to his servants See Joab s field is near mine and he has barley there go and set it on fire
And Absalom s servants set the field on fire
Then Joab arose and came to Absalom s house and said to him Why have your servants set my field on fire And Absalom answered Joab Look I sent to you saying Come here so that I may send you to the king to say Why have I come from Geshur It would be be er for me to be there s ll
Now therefore let me see the king s face but if there is iniquity in me let him execute me
So Joab went to the king and told him
And when he had called for Absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king
Then the king kissed Absalom
A er this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses and fi y men to run before him
Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate
So it was whenever anyone who had a lawsuit came to the king for a decision that Absalom would call to him and say What city are you from And he would say Your servant is from such and such a tribe of Israel
Then Absalom would say to him Look your case is good and right but there is no deputy of the king to hear you
Moreover Absalom would say Oh that I were made judge in the land and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me then I would give him jus ce
And so it was whenever anyone came near to bow down to him that he would put out his hand and take him and kiss him
In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment
So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel
Now it came to pass a er forty years that Absalom said to the king Please let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the LORD
For your servant took a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria saying If the LORD indeed brings me back to Jerusalem then I will serve the LORD
And the king said to him Go in peace
So he arose and went to Hebron
Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet then you shall say Absalom reigns in Hebron And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem and they went along innocently and did not know anything
Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite David s counselor from his city from Giloh while he offered sacrifices
And the conspiracy grew strong for the people with Absalom con nually increased in number
Now a messenger came to David saying The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom
So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem Arise and let us flee or we shall not escape from Absalom
Make haste to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us and strike the city with the edge of the sword
And the king s servants said to the king We are your servants ready to do whatever my lord the king commands
Then the king went out with all his household a er him
But the king le ten women concubines to keep the house
And the king went out with all the people a er him and stopped at the outskirts
Then all his servants passed before him and all the Cherethites all the Pelethites and all the Gi tes six hundred men who had followed him from Gath passed before the king
Then the king said to I ai the Gi te Why are you also going with us Return and remain with the king
For you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place
In fact you came only yesterday
Should I make you wander up and down with us today since I go I know not where Return and take your brethren back
Mercy and truth be with you
And I ai answered the king and said As the LORD lives and as my lord the king lives surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also your servant will be
So David said to I ai Go and cross over
Then I ai the Gi te and all his men and all the li le ones who were with him crossed over
And all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people crossed over
The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness
There was Zadok also and all the Levites with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God
And they set down the ark of God and Abiathar went up un l all the people had finished crossing over from the city
Then the king said to Zadok Carry the ark of God back into the city
If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place
But if He says thus I have no delight in you here I am let Him do to me as seems good to Him
The king also said to Zadok the priest Are you not a seer Return to the city in peace and your two sons with you Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar
See I will wait in the plains of the wilderness un l word comes from you to inform me
Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem
And they remained there
So David went up by the Ascent of the Mount of Olives and wept as he went up and he had his head covered and went barefoot
And all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up weeping as they went up
Then someone told David saying Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom
And David said O LORD I pray turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness Now it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain where he worshiped God there was Hushai the Archite coming to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head
David said to him If you go on with me then you will become a burden to me
But if you return to the city and say to Absalom I will be your servant O king as I was your father s servant previously so I will now also be your servant then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me
And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the king s house you shall tell to Zadok and Abiathar the priests
Indeed they have there with them their two sons Ahimaaz Zadok s son and Jonathan Abiathar s son and by them you shall send me everything you hear
So Hushai David s friend went into the city
And Absalom came into Jerusalem
When David was a li le past the top of the mountain there was Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys and on them two hundred loaves of bread one hundred clusters of raisins one hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine
And the king said to Ziba What do you mean to do with these So Ziba said The donkeys are for the king s household to ride on the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink
Then the king said And where is your master s son And Ziba said to the king Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem for he said Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me
So the king said to Ziba Here all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours
And Ziba said I humbly bow before you that I may find favor in your sight my lord O king Now when King David came to Bahurim there was a man from the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei the son of Gera coming from there
He came out cursing con nuously as he came
And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David
And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his le
Also Shimei said thus when he cursed Come out Come out You bloodthirsty man you rogue The LORD has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul in whose place you have reigned and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son
So now you are caught in your own evil because you are a bloodthirsty man Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king Please let me go over and take off his head But the king said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah So let him curse because the LORD has said to him Curse David
Who then shall say Why have you done so And David said to Abishai and all his servants See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life
How much more now may this Benjamite Let him alone and let him curse for so the LORD has ordered him
It may be that the LORD will look on my afflic on and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing this day
And as David and his men went along the road Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went threw stones at him and kicked up dust
Now the king and all the people who were with him became weary so they refreshed themselves there
Meanwhile Absalom and all the people the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel was with him
And so it was when Hushai the Archite David s friend came to Absalom that Hushai said to Absalom Long live the king Long live the king So Absalom said to Hushai Is this your loyalty to your friend Why did you not go with your friend And Hushai said to Absalom No but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose his I will be and with him I will remain
Furthermore whom should I serve Should I not serve in the presence of his son As I have served in your father s presence so will I be in your presence
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel Give counsel as to what we should do
And Ahithophel said to Absalom Go in to your father s concubines whom he has le to keep the house and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father
Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong
So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house and Absalom went in to his father s concubines in the sight of all Israel
Now the advice of Ahithophel which he gave in those days was as if one had inquired at the oracle of God
So was all the advice of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom
Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom Now let me choose twelve thousand men and I will arise and pursue David tonight
I will come upon him while he is weary and weak and make him afraid
And all the people who are with him will flee and I will strike only the king
Then I will bring back all the people to you
When all return except the man whom you seek all the people will be at peace
And the saying pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel
Then Absalom said Now call Hushai the Archite also and let us hear what he says too
And when Hushai came to Absalom Absalom spoke to him saying Ahithophel has spoken in this manner
Shall we do as he says If not speak up
So Hushai said to Absalom The advice that Ahithophel has given is not good at this me
For said Hushai you know your father and his men that they are mighty men and they are enraged in their minds like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field and your father is a man of war and will not camp with the people
Surely by now he is hidden in some pit or in some other place
And it will be when some of them are overthrown at the first that whoever hears it will say There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom
And even he who is valiant whose heart is like the heart of a lion will melt completely
For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men
Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you from Dan to Beersheba like the sand that is by the sea for mul tude and that you go to ba le in person
So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground
And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be le so much as one
Moreover if he has withdrawn into a city then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city and we will pull it into the river un l there is not one small stone found there
So Absalom and all the men of Israel said The advice of Hushai the Archite is be er than the advice of Ahithophel
For the LORD had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel to the intent that the LORD might bring disaster on Absalom
Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel and thus and so I have advised
Now therefore send quickly and tell David saying Do not spend this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily cross over lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel for they dared not be seen coming into the city so a female servant would come and tell them and they would go and tell King David
Nevertheless a lad saw them and told Absalom
But both of them went away quickly and came to a man s house in Bahurim who had a well in his court and they went down into it
Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well s mouth and spread ground grain on it and the thing was not known
And when Absalom s servants came to the woman at the house they said Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan So the woman said to them They have gone over the water brook
And when they had searched and could not find them they returned to Jerusalem
Now it came to pass a er they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told King David and said to David Arise and cross over the water quickly
For thus has Ahithophel advised against you
So David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed over the Jordan
By morning light not one of them was le who had not gone over the Jordan
Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his city
Then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and he was buried in his father s tomb
Then David went to Mahanaim
And Absalom crossed over the Jordan he and all the men of Israel with him
And Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab
This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra an Israelite who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash sister of Zeruiah Joab s mother
So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead
Now it happened when David had come to Mahanaim that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim brought beds and basins earthen vessels and wheat barley and flour parched grain and beans len ls and parched seeds honey and curds sheep and cheese of the herd for David and the people who were with him to eat
For they said The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness
And David numbered the people who were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them
Then David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah Joab s brother and one third under the hand of I ai the Gi te
And the king said to the people I also will surely go out with you myself
But the people answered You shall not go out For if we flee away they will not care about us nor if half of us die will they care about us
But you are worth ten thousand of us now
For you are now more help to us in the city
Then the king said to them Whatever seems best to you I will do
So the king stood beside the gate and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands
Now the king had commanded Joab Abishai and I ai saying Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom
And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom
So the people went out into the field of ba le against Israel
And the ba le was in the woods of Ephraim
The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day
For the ba le there was sca ered over the face of the whole countryside and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured
Then Absalom met the servants of David
Absalom rode on a mule
The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree and his head caught in the terebinth so he was le hanging between heaven and earth
And the mule which was under him went on
Now a certain man saw it and told Joab and said I just saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree So Joab said to the man who told him You just saw him And why did you not strike him there to the ground I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt
But the man said to Joab Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand I would not raise my hand against the king s son
For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and I ai saying Beware lest anyone touch the young man Absalom Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life
For there is nothing hidden from the king and you yourself would have set yourself against me
Then Joab said I cannot linger with you
And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom s heart while he was s ll alive in the midst of the terebinth tree
And ten young men who bore Joab s armor surrounded Absalom and struck and killed him
So Joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing Israel
For Joab held back the people
And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods and laid a very large heap of stones over him
Then all Israel fled everyone to his tent
Now Absalom in his life me had taken and set up a pillar for himself which is in the King s Valley
For he said I have no son to keep my name in remembrance
He called the pillar a er his own name
And to this day it is called Absalom s Monument
Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said Let me run now and take the news to the king how the LORD has avenged him of his enemies
And Joab said to him You shall not take the news this day for you shall take the news another day
But today you shall take no news because the king s son is dead
Then Joab said to the Cushite Go tell the king what you have seen
So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran
And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab But whatever happens please let me also run a er the Cushite
So Joab said Why will you run my son since you have no news ready But whatever happens he said let me run
So he said to him Run
Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite
Now David was si ng between the two gates
And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall li ed his eyes and looked and there was a man running alone
Then the watchman cried out and told the king
And the king said If he is alone there is news in his mouth
And he came rapidly and drew near
Then the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said There is another man running alone And the king said He also brings news
So the watchman said I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok
And the king said He is a good man and comes with good news
And Ahimaaz called out and said to the king All is well Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king and said Blessed be the LORD your God who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king The king said Is the young man Absalom safe Ahimaaz answered When Joab sent the king s servant and me your servant I saw a great tumult but I did not know what it was about
And the king said Turn aside and stand here
So he turned aside and stood s ll
Just then the Cushite came and the Cushite said There is good news my lord the king For the LORD has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you
And the king said to the Cushite Is the young man Absalom safe So the Cushite answered May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise against you to do harm be like that young man Then the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept
And as he went he said thus O my son Absalom my son my son Absalom if only I had died in your place O Absalom my son my son And Joab was told Behold the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom
So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people
For the people heard it said that day The king is grieved for his son
And the people stole back into the city that day as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in ba le
But the king covered his face and the king cried out with a loud voice O my son Absalom O Absalom my son my son Then Joab came into the house to the king and said Today you have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life the lives of your sons and daughters the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines in that you love your enemies and hate your friends
For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today then it would have pleased you well
Now therefore arise go out and speak comfort to your servants
For I swear by the LORD if you do not go out not one will stay with you this night
And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth un l now
Then the king arose and sat in the gate
And they told all the people saying There is the king si ng in the gate
So all the people came before the king
For everyone of Israel had fled to his tent
Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel saying The king saved us from the hand of our enemies he delivered us from the hand of the Philis nes and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom
But Absalom whom we anointed over us has died in ba le
Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing back the king So King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests saying Speak to the elders of Judah saying Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house since the words of all Israel have come to the king to his very house You are my brethren you are my bone and my flesh
Why then are you the last to bring back the king And say to Amasa Are you not my bone and my flesh God do so to me and more also if you are not commander of the army before me con nually in place of Joab
So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah just as the heart of one man so that they sent this word to the king Return you and all your servants Then the king returned and came to the Jordan
And Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king to escort the king across the Jordan
And Shimei the son of Gera a Benjamite who was from Bahurim hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David
There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul and his fi een sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over the Jordan before the king
Then a ferryboat went across to carry over the king s household and to do what he thought good
Now Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan
Then he said to the king Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me or remember what wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king le Jerusalem that the king should take it to heart
For I your servant know that I have sinned
Therefore here I am the first to come today of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said Shall not Shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the LORD S anointed And David said What have I to do with you you sons of Zeruiah that you should be adversaries to me today Shall any man be put to death today in Israel For do I not know that today I am king over Israel Therefore the king said to Shimei You shall not die
And the king swore to him
Now Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king
And he had not cared for his feet nor trimmed his mustache nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed un l the day he returned in peace
So it was when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king that the king said to him Why did you not go with me Mephibosheth And he answered My lord O king my servant deceived me
For your servant said I will saddle a donkey for myself that I may ride on it and go to the king because your servant is lame
And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king but my lord the king is like the angel of God
Therefore do what is good in your eyes
For all my father s house were but dead men before my lord the king
Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table
Therefore what right have I s ll to cry out anymore to the king So the king said to him Why do you speak anymore of your ma ers I have said You and Ziba divide the land
Then Mephibosheth said to the king Rather let him take it all inasmuch as my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house
And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went across the Jordan with the king to escort him across the Jordan
Now Barzillai was a very aged man eighty years old
And he had provided the king with supplies while he stayed at Mahanaim for he was a very rich man
And the king said to Barzillai Come across with me and I will provide for you while you are with me in Jerusalem
But Barzillai said to the king How long have I to live that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem I am today eighty years old
Can I discern between the good and bad Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink Can I hear any longer the voice of singing men and singing women Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king Your servant will go a li le way across the Jordan with the king
And why should the king repay me with such a reward Please let your servant turn back again that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and mother
But here is your servant Chimham let him cross over with my lord the king and do for him what seems good to you
And the king answered Chimham shall cross over with me and I will do for him what seems good to you
Now whatever you request of me I will do for you
Then all the people went over the Jordan
And when the king had crossed over the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him and he returned to his own place
Now the king went on to Gilgal and Chimham went on with him
And all the people of Judah escorted the king and also half the people of Israel
Just then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king his household and all David s men with him across the Jordan So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel Because the king is a close rela ve of ours
Why then are you angry over this ma er Have we ever eaten at the king s expense Or has he given us any gi And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said We have ten shares in the king therefore we also have more right to David than you
Why then do you despise us were we not the first to advise bringing back our king Yet the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel
And there happened to be there a rebel whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri a Benjamite
And he blew a trumpet and said We have no share in David Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse Every man to his tents O Israel So every man of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri
But the men of Judah from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem remained loyal to their king
Now David came to his house at Jerusalem
And the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had le to keep the house and put them in seclusion and supported them but did not go in to them
So they were shut up to the day of their death living in widowhood
And the king said to Amasa Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days and be present here yourself
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah
But he delayed longer than the set me which David had appointed him
And David said to Abishai Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom
Take your lord s servants and pursue him lest he find for himself for fied ci es and escape us
So Joab s men with the Cherethites the Pelethites and all the mighty men went out a er him
And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri
When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon Amasa came before them
Now Joab was dressed in ba le armor on it was a belt with a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips and as he was going forward it fell out
Then Joab said to Amasa Are you in health my brother And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him
But Amasa did not no ce the sword that was in Joab s hand
And he struck him with it in the stomach and his entrails poured out on the ground and he did not strike him again
Thus he died
Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri
Meanwhile one of Joab s men stood near Amasa and said Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David follow Joab But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the highway
And when the man saw that all the people stood s ll he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted
When he was removed from the highway all the people went on a er Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri
And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites
So they were gathered together and also went a er Sheba
Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah and they cast up a siege mound against the city and it stood by the rampart
And all the people who were with Joab ba ered the wall to throw it down
Then a wise woman cried out from the city Hear Hear Please say to Joab Come nearby that I may speak with you
When he had come near to her the woman said Are you Joab He answered I am
Then she said to him Hear the words of your maidservant
And he answered I am listening
So she spoke saying They used to talk in former mes saying They shall surely seek guidance at Abel and so they would end disputes
I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel
You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel
Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD And Joab answered and said Far be it far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy That is not so
But a man from the mountains of Ephraim Sheba the son of Bichri by name has raised his hand against the king against David
Deliver him only and I will depart from the city
So the woman said to Joab Watch his head will be thrown to you over the wall
Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people
And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab
Then he blew a trumpet and they withdrew from the city every man to his tent
So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem
And Joab was over all the army of Israel Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites Adoram was in charge of revenue Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder Sheva was scribe Zadok and Abiathar were the priests and Ira the Jairite was a chief minister under David
Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years year a er year and David inquired of the LORD
And the LORD answered It is because of Saul and his bloodthirsty house because he killed the Gibeonites
So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them
Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites the children of Israel had sworn protec on to them but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah
Therefore David said to the Gibeonites What shall I do for you And with what shall I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD And the Gibeonites said to him We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us
So he said Whatever you say I will do for you
Then they answered the king As for the man who consumed us and plo ed against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territories of Israel let seven men of his descendants be delivered to us and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul whom the LORD chose
And the king said I will give them
But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul because of the LORD S oath that was between them between David and Jonathan the son of Saul
So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah whom she bore to Saul and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD
So they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest
Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock from the beginning of harvest un l the late rains poured on them from heaven
And she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night
And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done
Then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan where the Philis nes had hung them up a er the Philis nes had struck down Saul in Gilboa
So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged
They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zelah in the tomb of Kish his father
So they performed all that the king commanded
And a er that God heeded the prayer for the land
When the Philis nes were at war again with Israel David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philis nes and David grew faint
Then Ishbi Benob who was one of the sons of the giant the weight of whose bronze spear was three hundred shekels who was bearing a new sword thought he could kill David
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and struck the Philis ne and killed him
Then the men of David swore to him saying You shall go out no more with us to ba le lest you quench the lamp of Israel
Now it happened a erward that there was again a ba le with the Philis nes at Gob
Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph who was one of the sons of the giant
Again there was war at Gob with the Philis nes where Elhanan the son of Jaare Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gi te the sha of whose spear was like a weaver s beam
Yet again there was war at Gath where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot twenty four in number and he also was born to the giant
So when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Shimea David s brother killed him
These four were born to the giant in Gath and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants
Then David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day when the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul
And he said The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer The God of my strength in whom I will trust My shield and the horn of my salva on My stronghold and my refuge My Savior You save me from violence
I will call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised So shall I be saved from my enemies
When the waves of death surrounded me The floods of ungodliness made me afraid
The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me The snares of death confronted me
In my distress I called upon the LORD And cried out to my God He heard my voice from His temple And my cry entered His ears
Then the earth shook and trembled The founda ons of heaven quaked and were shaken Because He was angry
Smoke went up from His nostrils And devouring fire from His mouth Coals were kindled by it
He bowed the heavens also and came down With darkness under His feet
He rode upon a cherub and flew And He was seen upon the wings of the wind
He made darkness canopies around Him Dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
From the brightness before Him Coals of fire were kindled
The LORD thundered from heaven And the Most High u ered His voice
He sent out arrows and sca ered them Lightning bolts and He vanquished them
Then the channels of the sea were seen The founda ons of the world were uncovered At the rebuke of the LORD At the blast of the breath of His nostrils
He sent from above He took me He drew me out of many waters
He delivered me from my strong enemy From those who hated me For they were too strong for me
They confronted me in the day of my calamity But the LORD was my support
He also brought me out into a broad place He delivered me because He delighted in me
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me
For I have kept the ways of the LORD And have not wickedly departed from my God
For all His judgments were before me And as for His statutes I did not depart from them
I was also blameless before Him And I kept myself from my iniquity
Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness According to my cleanness in His eyes
With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless With the pure You will show Yourself pure And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd
You will save the humble people But Your eyes are on the haughty that You may bring them down
For You are my lamp O LORD The LORD shall enlighten my darkness
For by You I can run against a troop By my God I can leap over a wall
As for God His way is perfect The word of the LORD is proven He is a shield to all who trust in Him
For who is God except the LORD And who is a rock except our God God is my strength and power And He makes my way perfect
He makes my feet like the feet of deer And sets me on my high places
He teaches my hands to make war So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze
You have also given me the shield of Your salva on Your gentleness has made me great
You enlarged my path under me So my feet did not slip
I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them Neither did I turn back again ll they were destroyed
And I have destroyed them and wounded them So that they could not rise They have fallen under my feet
For You have armed me with strength for the ba le You have subdued under me those who rose against me
You have also given me the necks of my enemies So that I destroyed those who hated me
They looked but there was none to save Even to the LORD but He did not answer them
Then I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth I trod them like dirt in the streets And I spread them out
You have also delivered me from the strivings of my people You have kept me as the head of the na ons
A people I have not known shall serve me
The foreigners submit to me As soon as they hear they obey me
The foreigners fade away And come frightened from their hideouts
The LORD lives Blessed be my Rock Let God be exalted The Rock of my salva on It is God who avenges me And subdues the peoples under me He delivers me from my enemies
You also li me up above those who rise against me You have delivered me from the violent man
Therefore I will give thanks to You O LORD among the Gen les And sing praises to Your name
He is the tower of salva on to His king And shows mercy to His anointed To David and his descendants forevermore
Now these are the last words of David
Thus says David the son of Jesse Thus says the man raised up on high The anointed of the God of Jacob And the sweet psalmist of Israel The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me And His word was on my tongue
The God of Israel said The Rock of Israel spoke to me He who rules over men must be just Ruling in the fear of God
And he shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises A morning without clouds Like the tender grass springing out of the earth By clear shining a er rain
Although my house is not so with God Yet He has made with me an everlas ng covenant Ordered in all things and secure
For this is all my salva on and all my desire Will He not make it increase But the sons of rebellion shall all be as thorns thrust away Because they cannot be taken with hands
But the man who touches them Must be armed with iron and the sha of a spear And they shall be u erly burned with fire in their place
These are the names of the mighty men whom David had Josheb Basshebeth the Tachmonite chief among the captains
He was called Adino the Eznite because he had killed eight hundred men at one me
And a er him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philis nes who were gathered there for ba le and the men of Israel had retreated
He arose and a acked the Philis nes un l his hand was weary and his hand stuck to the sword
The LORD brought about a great victory that day and the people returned a er him only to plunder
And a er him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite
The Philis nes had gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of len ls
Then the people fled from the Philis nes
But he sta oned himself in the middle of the field defended it and killed the Philis nes
And the LORD brought about a great victory
Then three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest me and came to David at the cave of Adullam
And the troop of Philis nes encamped in the Valley of Rephaim
David was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the Philis nes was then in Bethlehem
And David said with longing Oh that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philis nes drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David
Nevertheless he would not drink it but poured it out to the LORD
And he said Far be it from me O LORD that I should do this Is this not the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives Therefore he would not drink it
These things were done by the three mighty men
Now Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief of another three
He li ed his spear against three hundred men killed them and won a name among these three
Was he not the most honored of three Therefore he became their captain
However he did not a ain to the first three
Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel who had done many deeds
He had killed two lion like heroes of Moab
He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day
And he killed an Egyp an a spectacular man
The Egyp an had a spear in his hand so he went down to him with a staff wrested the spear out of the Egyp an s hand and killed him with his own spear
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did and won a name among three mighty men
He was more honored than the thirty but he did not a ain to the first three
And David appointed him over his guard
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem Shammah the Harodite Elika the Harodite Helez the Pal te Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite Abiezer the Anathothite Mebunnai the Hushathite Zalmon the Ahohite Maharai the Netophathite Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite I ai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin Benaiah a Pirathonite Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash Abi Albon the Arbathite Azmaveth the Barhumite Eliahba the Shaalbonite of the sons of Jashen Jonathan Shammah the Hararite Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maachathite Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite Hezrai the Carmelite Paarai the Arbite Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah Bani the Gadite Zelek the Ammonite Naharai the Beerothite armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah Ira the Ithrite Gareb the Ithrite and Uriah the Hi te thirty seven in all
Again the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel and He moved David against them to say Go number Israel and Judah
So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and count the people that I may know the number of the people
And Joab said to the king Now may the LORD your God add to the people a hundred mes more than there are and may the eyes of my lord the king see it
But why does my lord the king desire this thing Nevertheless the king s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army
Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel
And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the ravine of Gad and toward Jazer
Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tah m Hodshi they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the ci es of the Hivites and the Canaanites
Then they went out to South Judah as far as Beersheba
So when they had gone through all the land they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king
And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men
And David s heart condemned him a er he had numbered the people
So David said to the LORD I have sinned greatly in what I have done but now I pray O LORD take away the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly
Now when David arose in the morning the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad David s seer saying Go and tell David Thus says the LORD I offer you three things choose one of them for yourself that I may do it to you
So Gad came to David and told him and he said to him Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land Or shall you flee three months before your enemies while they pursue you Or shall there be three days plague in your land Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me
And David said to Gad I am in great distress
Please let us fall into the hand of the LORD for His mercies are great but do not let me fall into the hand of man
So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from the morning ll the appointed me
From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died
And when the angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it the LORD relented from the destruc on and said to the angel who was destroying the people It is enough now restrain your hand
And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people and said Surely I have sinned and I have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done Let Your hand I pray be against me and against my father s house
And Gad came that day to David and said to him Go up erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
So David according to the word of Gad went up as the LORD commanded
Now Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming toward him
So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground
Then Araunah said Why has my lord the king come to his servant And David said To buy the threshing floor from you to build an altar to the LORD that the plague may be withdrawn from the people
Now Araunah said to David Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him
Look here are oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood
All these O king Araunah has given to the king
And Araunah said to the king May the LORD your God accept you
Then the king said to Araunah No but I will surely buy it from you for a price nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing
So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fi y shekels of silver
And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
So the LORD heeded the prayers for the land and the plague was withdrawn from Israel
Kings Now King David was old advanced in years and they put covers on him but he could not get warm
Therefore his servants said to him Let a young woman a virgin be sought for our lord the king and let her stand before the king and let her care for him and let her lie in your bosom that our lord the king may be warm
So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel and found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king
The young woman was very lovely and she cared for the king and served him but the king did not know her
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself saying I will be king and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen and fi y men to run before him
And his father had not rebuked him at any me by saying Why have you done so He was also very good looking
His mother had borne him a er Absalom
Then he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest and they followed and helped Adonijah
But Zadok the priest Benaiah the son of Jehoiada Nathan the prophet Shimei Rei and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah
And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fa ened ca le by the stone of Zoheleth which is by En Rogel he also invited all his brothers the king s sons and all the men of Judah the king s servants
But he did not invite Nathan the prophet Benaiah the mighty men or Solomon his brother
So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon saying Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it Come please let me now give you advice that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon
Go immediately to King David and say to him Did you not my lord O king swear to your maidservant saying Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign a er me and he shall sit on my throne Why then has Adonijah become king Then while you are s ll talking there with the king I also will come in a er you and confirm your words
So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king
Now the king was very old and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king
And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king
Then the king said What is your wish Then she said to him My lord you swore by the LORD your God to your maidservant saying Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign a er me and he shall sit on my throne
So now look Adonijah has become king and now my lord the king you do not know about it
He has sacrificed oxen and fa ened ca le and sheep in abundance and has invited all the sons of the king Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army but Solomon your servant he has not invited
And as for you my lord O king the eyes of all Israel are on you that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king a er him
Otherwise it will happen when my lord the king rests with his fathers that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders
And just then while she was s ll talking with the king Nathan the prophet also came in
So they told the king saying Here is Nathan the prophet
And when he came in before the king he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground
And Nathan said My lord O king have you said Adonijah shall reign a er me and he shall sit on my throne For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fa ened ca le and sheep in abundance and has invited all the king s sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest and look They are ea ng and drinking before him and they say Long live King Adonijah But he has not invited me me your servant nor Zadok the priest nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada nor your servant Solomon
Has this thing been done by my lord the king and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king a er him Then King David answered and said Call Bathsheba to me
So she came into the king s presence and stood before the king
And the king took an oath and said As the LORD lives who has redeemed my life from every distress just as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel saying Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king a er me and he shall sit on my throne in my place so I certainly will do this day
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and paid homage to the king and said Let my lord King David live forever And King David said Call to me Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
So they came before the king
The king also said to them Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule and take him down to Gihon
There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel and blow the horn and say Long live King Solomon Then you shall come up a er him and he shall come and sit on my throne and he shall be king in my place
For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said Amen May the LORD God of my lord the king say so too
As the LORD has been with my lord the king even so may He be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David
So Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David s mule and took him to Gihon
Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon
And they blew the horn and all the people said Long live King Solomon And all the people went up a er him and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth seemed to split with their sound
Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished ea ng
And when Joab heard the sound of the horn he said Why is the city in such a noisy uproar While he was s ll speaking there came Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest
And Adonijah said to him Come in for you are a prominent man and bring good news
Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah No Our lord King David has made Solomon king
The king has sent with him Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the Cherethites and the Pelethites and they have made him ride on the king s mule
So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon and they have gone up from there rejoicing so that the city is in an uproar
This is the noise that you have heard
Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom
And moreover the king s servants have gone to bless our lord King David saying May God make the name of Solomon be er than your name and may He make his throne greater than your throne
Then the king bowed himself on the bed
Also the king said thus Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who has given one to sit on my throne this day while my eyes see it So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid and arose and each one went his way
Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon so he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar
And it was told Solomon saying Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon for look he has taken hold of the horns of the altar saying Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword
Then Solomon said If he proves himself a worthy man not one hair of him shall fall to the earth but if wickedness is found in him he shall die
So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar
And he came and fell down before King Solomon and Solomon said to him Go to your house
Now the days of David drew near that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of all the earth be strong therefore and prove yourself a man
And keep the charge of the LORD your God to walk in His ways to keep His statutes His commandments His judgments and His tes monies as it is written in the Law of Moses that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn that the LORD may fulfill His word which He spoke concerning me saying If your sons take heed to their way to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul He said you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel
Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel to Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether whom he killed
And he shed the blood of war in peace me and put the blood of war on his belt that was around his waist and on his sandals that were on his feet
Therefore do according to your wisdom and do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace
But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother
And see you have with you Shimei the son of Gera a Benjamite from Bahurim who cursed me with a malicious curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim
But he came down to meet me at the Jordan and I swore to him by the LORD saying I will not put you to death with the sword
Now therefore do not hold him guiltless for you are a wise man and know what you ought to do to him but bring his gray hair down to the grave with blood
So David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David
The period that David reigned over Israel was forty years seven years he reigned in Hebron and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty three years
Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David and his kingdom was firmly established
Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon
So she said Do you come peaceably And he said Peaceably
Moreover he said I have something to say to you
And she said Say it
Then he said You know that the kingdom was mine and all Israel had set their expecta ons on me that I should reign
However the kingdom has been turned over and has become my brother s for it was his from the LORD
Now I ask one pe on of you do not deny me
And she said to him Say it
Then he said Please speak to King Solomon for he will not refuse you that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife
So Bathsheba said Very well I will speak for you to the king
Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah
And the king rose up to meet her and bowed down to her and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king s mother so she sat at his right hand
Then she said I desire one small pe on of you do not refuse me
And the king said to her Ask it my mother for I will not refuse you
So she said Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife
And King Solomon answered and said to his mother Now why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah Ask for him the kingdom also for he is my older brother for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab the son of Zeruiah
Then King Solomon swore by the LORD saying May God do so to me and more also if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life Now therefore as the LORD lives who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father and who has established a house for me as He promised Adonijah shall be put to death today So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and he struck him down and he died
And to Abiathar the priest the king said Go to Anathoth to your own fields for you are deserving of death but I will not put you to death at this me because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David and because you were afflicted every me my father was afflicted
So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD that he might fulfill the word of the LORD which He spoke concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh
Then news came to Joab for Joab had defected to Adonijah though he had not defected to Absalom
So Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar
And King Solomon was told Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the LORD there he is by the altar
Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada saying Go strike him down
So Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the LORD and said to him Thus says the king Come out And he said No but I will die here
And Benaiah brought back word to the king saying Thus said Joab and thus he answered me
Then the king said to him Do as he has said and strike him down and bury him that you may take away from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab shed
So the LORD will return his blood on his head because he struck down two men more righteous and be er than he and killed them with the sword Abner the son of Ner the commander of the army of Israel and Amasa the son of Jether the commander of the army of Judah though my father David did not know it
Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever
But upon David and his descendants upon his house and his throne there shall be peace forever from the LORD
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness
The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar
Then the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there and do not go out from there anywhere
For it shall be on the day you go out and cross the Brook Kidron know for certain you shall surely die your blood shall be on your own head
And Shimei said to the king The saying is good
As my lord the king has said so your servant will do
So Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days
Now it happened at the end of three years that two slaves of Shimei ran away to Achish the son of Maachah king of Gath
And they told Shimei saying Look your slaves are in Gath So Shimei arose saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves
And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath
And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back
Then the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you saying Know for certain that on the day you go out and travel anywhere you shall surely die And you said to me The word I have heard is good
Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I gave you The king said moreover to Shimei You know as your heart acknowledges all the wickedness that you did to my father David therefore the LORD will return your wickedness on your own head
But King Solomon shall be blessed and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever
So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and he went out and struck him down and he died
Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon
Now Solomon made a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married Pharaoh s daughter then he brought her to the City of David un l he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall all around Jerusalem
Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places because there was no house built for the name of the LORD un l those days
And Solomon loved the LORD walking in the statutes of his father David except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places
Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar
At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said Ask What shall I give you And Solomon said You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father because he walked before You in truth in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with You You have con nued this great kindness for him and You have given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day
Now O LORD my God You have made Your servant king instead of my father David but I am a li le child I do not know how to go out or come in
And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen a great people too numerous to be numbered or counted
Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people that I may discern between good and evil
For who is able to judge this great people of Yours The speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing
Then God said to him Because you have asked this thing and have not asked long life for yourself nor have asked riches for yourself nor have asked the life of your enemies but have asked for yourself understanding to discern jus ce behold I have done according to your words see I have given you a wise and understanding heart so that there has not been anyone like you before you nor shall any like you arise a er you
And I have also given you what you have not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days
So if you walk in My ways to keep My statutes and My commandments as your father David walked then I will lengthen your days
Then Solomon awoke and indeed it had been a dream
And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD offered up burnt offerings offered peace offerings and made a feast for all his servants
Now two women who were harlots came to the king and stood before him
And one woman said O my lord this woman and I dwell in the same house and I gave birth while she was in the house
Then it happened the third day a er I had given birth that this woman also gave birth
And we were together no one was with us in the house except the two of us in the house
And this woman s son died in the night because she lay on him
So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your maidservant slept and laid him in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom
And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son there he was dead
But when I had examined him in the morning indeed he was not my son whom I had borne
Then the other woman said No But the living one is my son and the dead one is your son
And the first woman said No But the dead one is your son and the living one is my son
Thus they spoke before the king
And the king said The one says This is my son who lives and your son is the dead one and the other says No But your son is the dead one and my son is the living one
Then the king said Bring me a sword
So they brought a sword before the king
And the king said Divide the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other
Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king for she yearned with compassion for her son and she said O my lord give her the living child and by no means kill him But the other said Let him be neither mine nor yours but divide him
So the king answered and said Give the first woman the living child and by no means kill him she is his mother
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer jus ce
So King Solomon was king over all Israel
And these were his officials Azariah the son of Zadok the priest Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha scribes Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud the recorder Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army Zadok and Abiathar the priests Azariah the son of Nathan over the officers Zabud the son of Nathan a priest and the king s friend Ahishar over the household and Adoniram the son of Abda over the labor force
And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel who provided food for the king and his household each one made provision for one month of the year
These are their names Ben Hur in the mountains of Ephraim Ben Deker in Makaz Shaalbim Beth Shemesh and Elon Beth Hanan Ben Hesed in Arubboth to him belonged Sochoh and all the land of Hepher Ben Abinadab in all the regions of Dor he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife Baana the son of Ahilud in Taanach Megiddo and all Beth Shean which is beside Zaretan below Jezreel from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah as far as the other side of Jokneam Ben Geber in Ramoth Gilead to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh in Gilead to him also belonged the region of Argob in Bashan sixty large ci es with walls and bronze gate bars Ahinadab the son of Iddo in Mahanaim Ahimaaz in Naphtali he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife Baanah the son of Hushai in Asher and Aloth Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah in Issachar Shimei the son of Elah in Benjamin Geber the son of Uri in the land of Gilead in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan
He was the only governor who was in the land
Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea in mul tude ea ng and drinking and rejoicing
So Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philis nes as far as the border of Egypt
They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life
Now Solomon s provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour sixty kors of meal ten fa ed oxen twenty oxen from the pastures and one hundred sheep besides deer gazelles roebucks and fa ed fowl
For he had dominion over all the region on this side of the River from Tiphsah even to Gaza namely over all the kings on this side of the River and he had peace on every side all around him
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely each man under his vine and his fig tree from Dan as far as Beersheba all the days of Solomon
Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen
And these governors each man in his month provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon s table
There was no lack in their supply
They also brought barley and straw to the proper place for the horses and steeds each man according to his charge
And God gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding and largeness of heart like the sand on the seashore
Thus Solomon s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the men of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt
For he was wiser than all men than Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman Chalcol and Darda the sons of Mahol and his fame was in all the surrounding na ons
He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs were one thousand and five
Also he spoke of trees from the cedar tree of Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall he spoke also of animals of birds of creeping things and of fish
And men of all na ons from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom came to hear the wisdom of Solomon
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon because he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father for Hiram had always loved David
Then Solomon sent to Hiram saying You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side un l the LORD put his foes under the soles of his feet
But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence
And behold I propose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God as the LORD spoke to my father David saying Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place he shall build the house for My name
Now therefore command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon and my servants will be with your servants and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say
For you know there is none among us who has skill to cut mber like the Sidonians
So it was when Hiram heard the words of Solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said Blessed be the LORD this day for He has given David a wise son over this great people Then Hiram sent to Solomon saying I have considered the message which you sent me and I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs
My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea I will float them in ra s by sea to the place you indicate to me and will have them broken apart there then you can take them away
And you shall fulfill my desire by giving food for my household
Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs according to all his desire
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household and twenty kors of pressed oil
Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year
So the LORD gave Solomon wisdom as He had promised him and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and the two of them made a treaty together
Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel and the labor force was thirty thousand men
And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month in shi s they were one month in Lebanon and two months at home Adoniram was in charge of the labor force
Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens and eighty thousand who quarried stone in the mountains besides three thousand three hundred from the chiefs of Solomon s depu es who supervised the people who labored in the work
And the king commanded them to quarry large stones costly stones and hewn stones to lay the founda on of the temple
So Solomon s builders Hiram s builders and the Gebalites quarried them and they prepared mber and stones to build the temple
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eigh eth year a er the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomon s reign over Israel in the month of Ziv which is the second month that he began to build the house of the LORD
Now the house which King Solomon built for the LORD its length was sixty cubits its width twenty and its height thirty cubits
The ves bule in front of the sanctuary of the house was twenty cubits long across the width of the house and the width of the ves ble extended ten cubits from the front of the house
And he made for the house windows with beveled frames
Against the wall of the temple he built chambers all around against the walls of the temple all around the sanctuary and the inner sanctuary
Thus he made side chambers all around it
The lowest chamber was five cubits wide the middle was six cubits wide and the third was seven cubits wide for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the temple so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the temple
And the temple when it was being built was built with stone finished at the quarry so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built
The doorway for the middle story was on the right side of the temple
They went up by stairs to the middle story and from the middle to the third
So he built the temple and finished it and he paneled the temple with beams and boards of cedar
And he built side chambers against the en re temple each five cubits high they were a ached to the temple with cedar beams
Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon saying Concerning this temple which you are building if you walk in My statutes execute My judgments keep all My commandments and walk in them then I will perform My word with you which I spoke to your father David
And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My people Israel
So Solomon built the temple and finished it
And he built the inside walls of the temple with cedar boards from the floor of the temple to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood and he covered the floor of the temple with planks of cypress
Then he built the twenty cubit room at the rear of the temple from floor to ceiling with cedar boards he built it inside as the inner sanctuary as the Most Holy Place
And in front of it the temple sanctuary was forty cubits long
The inside of the temple was cedar carved with ornamental buds and open flowers
All was cedar there was no stone to be seen
And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there
The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high
He overlaid it with pure gold and overlaid the altar of cedar
So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold
He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid it with gold
The whole temple he overlaid with gold un l he had finished all the temple also he overlaid with gold the en re altar that was by the inner sanctuary
Inside the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood each ten cubits high
One wing of the cherub was five cubits and the other wing of the cherub five cubits ten cubits from the p of one wing to the p of the other
And the other cherub was ten cubits both cherubim were of the same size and shape
The height of one cherub was ten cubits and so was the other cherub
Then he set the cherubim inside the inner room and they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall
And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room
Also he overlaid the cherubim with gold
Then he carved all the walls of the temple all around both the inner and outer sanctuaries with carved figures of cherubim palm trees and open flowers
And the floor of the temple he overlaid with gold both the inner and outer sanctuaries
For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood the lintel and doorposts were one fi h of the wall
The two doors were of olive wood and he carved on them figures of cherubim palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and he spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees
So for the door of the sanctuary he also made doorposts of olive wood one fourth of the wall
And the two doors were of cypress wood two panels comprised one folding door and two panels comprised the other folding door
Then he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold applied evenly on the carved work
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams
In the fourth year the founda on of the house of the LORD was laid in the month of Ziv
And in the eleventh year in the month of Bul which is the eighth month the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans
So he was seven years in building it
But Solomon took thirteen years to build his own house so he finished all his house
He also built the House of the Forest of Lebanon its length was one hundred cubits its width fi y cubits and its height thirty cubits with four rows of cedar pillars and cedar beams on the pillars
And it was paneled with cedar above the beams that were on forty five pillars fi een to a row
There were windows with beveled frames in three rows and window was opposite window in three ers
And all the doorways and doorposts had rectangular frames and window was opposite window in three ers
He also made the Hall of Pillars its length was fi y cubits and its width thirty cubits and in front of them was a por co with pillars and a canopy was in front of them
Then he made a hall for the throne the Hall of Judgment where he might judge and it was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling
And the house where he dwelt had another court inside the hall of like workmanship
Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh s daughter whom he had taken as wife
All these were of costly stones cut to size trimmed with saws inside and out from the founda on to the eaves and also on the outside to the great court
The founda on was of costly stones large stones some ten cubits and some eight cubits
And above were costly stones hewn to size and cedar wood
The great court was enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams
So were the inner court of the house of the LORD and the ves bule of the temple
Now King Solomon sent and brought Huram from Tyre
He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and his father was a man of Tyre a bronze worker he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of bronze work
So he came to King Solomon and did all his work
And he cast two pillars of bronze each one eighteen cubits high and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each
Then he made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars
The height of one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits
He made a la ce network with wreaths of chainwork for the capitals which were on top of the pillars seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital
So he made the pillars and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that were on top and thus he did for the other capital
The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were in the shape of lilies four cubits
The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above by the convex surface which was next to the network and there were two hundred such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around
Then he set up the pillars by the ves bule of the temple he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin and he set up the pillar on the le and called its name Boaz
The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies
So the work of the pillars was finished
And he made the Sea of cast bronze ten cubits from one brim to the other it was completely round
Its height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference
Below its brim were ornamental buds encircling it all around ten to a cubit all the way around the Sea
The ornamental buds were cast in two rows when it was cast
It stood on twelve oxen three looking toward the north three looking toward the west three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east the Sea was set upon them and all their back parts pointed inward
It was a handbreadth thick and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup like a lily blossom
It contained two thousand baths
He also made ten carts of bronze four cubits was the length of each cart four cubits its width and three cubits its height
And this was the design of the carts They had panels and the panels were between frames on the panels that were between the frames were lions oxen and cherubim
And on the frames was a pedestal on top
Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of plaited work
Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze and its four feet had supports
Under the laver were supports of cast bronze beside each wreath
Its opening inside the crown at the top was one cubit in diameter and the opening was round shaped like a pedestal one and a half cubits in outside diameter and also on the opening were engravings but the panels were square not round
Under the panels were the four wheels and the axles of the wheels were joined to the cart
The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits
The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel their axle pins their rims their spokes and their hubs were all of cast bronze
And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart its supports were part of the cart itself
On the top of the cart at the height of half a cubit it was perfectly round
And on the top of the cart its flanges and its panels were of the same cas ng
On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim lions and palm trees wherever there was a clear space on each with wreaths all around
Thus he made the ten carts
All of them were of the same mold one measure and one shape
Then he made ten lavers of bronze each laver contained forty baths and each laver was four cubits
On each of the ten carts was a laver
And he put five carts on the right side of the house and five on the le side of the house
He set the Sea on the right side of the house toward the southeast
Huram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls
So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of the LORD the two pillars the two bowl shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars the two networks covering the two bowl shaped capitals which were on top of the pillars four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowl shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars the ten carts and ten lavers on the carts one Sea and twelve oxen under the Sea the pots the shovels and the bowls
All these ar cles which Huram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of burnished bronze
In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds between Succoth and Zaretan
And Solomon did not weigh all the ar cles because there were so many the weight of the bronze was not determined
Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the LORD the altar of gold and the table of gold on which was the showbread the lampstands of pure gold five on the right side and five on the le in front of the inner sanctuary with the flowers and the lamps and the wick trimmers of gold the basins the trimmers the bowls the ladles and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner room the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the main hall of the temple
So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was finished and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated the silver and the gold and the furnishings
He put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD
Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief fathers of the children of Israel to King Solomon in Jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the City of David which is Zion
Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim which is the seventh month
So all the elders of Israel came and the priests took up the ark
Then they brought up the ark of the LORD the tabernacle of mee ng and all the holy furnishings that were in the tabernacle
The priests and the Levites brought them up
Also King Solomon and all the congrega on of Israel who were assembled with him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for mul tude
Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place into the inner sanctuary of the temple to the Most Holy Place under the wings of the cherubim
For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles
The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary but they could not be seen from outside
And they are there to this day
Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt
And it came to pass when the priests came out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the LORD so that the priests could not con nue ministering because of the cloud for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD
Then Solomon spoke The LORD said He would dwell in the dark cloud
I have surely built You an exalted house And a place for You to dwell in forever
Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel while all the assembly of Israel was standing
And he said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who spoke with His mouth to my father David and with His hand has fulfilled it saying Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there but I chose David to be over My people Israel
Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel
But the LORD said to my father David Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name you did well that it was in your heart
Nevertheless you shall not build the temple but your son who will come from your body he shall build the temple for My name
So the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke and I have filled the posi on of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel as the LORD promised and I have built a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel
And there I have made a place for the ark in which is the covenant of the LORD which He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt
Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven and he said LORD God of Israel there is no God in heaven above or on earth below like You who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts
You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day
Therefore LORD God of Israel now keep what You promised Your servant David my father saying You shall not fail to have a man sit before Me on the throne of Israel only if your sons take heed to their way that they walk before Me as you have walked before Me
And now I pray O God of Israel let Your word come true which You have spoken to Your servant David my father
But will God indeed dwell on the earth Behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You
How much less this temple which I have built Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplica on O LORD my God and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today that Your eyes may be open toward this temple night and day toward the place of which You said My name shall be there that You may hear the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place
And may You hear the supplica on of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place
Hear in heaven Your dwelling place and when You hear forgive
When anyone sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath and comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this temple then hear in heaven and act and judge Your servants condemning the wicked bringing his way on his head and jus fying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness
When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You and when they turn back to You and confess Your name and pray and make supplica on to You in this temple then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers
When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You when they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin because You afflict them then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants Your people Israel that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance
When there is famine in the land pes lence or blight or mildew locusts or grasshoppers when their enemy besieges them in the land of their ci es whatever plague or whatever sickness there is whatever prayer whatever supplica on is made by anyone or by all Your people Israel when each one knows the plague of his own heart and spreads out his hands toward this temple then hear in heaven Your dwelling place and forgive and act and give to everyone according to all his ways whose heart You know for You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You gave to our fathers
Moreover concerning a foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a far country for Your name s sake for they will hear of Your great name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm when he comes and prays toward this temple hear in heaven Your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You as do Your people Israel and that they may know that this temple which I have built is called by Your name
When Your people go out to ba le against their enemy wherever You send them and when they pray to the LORD toward the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplica on and maintain their cause
When they sin against You for there is no one who does not sin and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy and they take them cap ve to the land of the enemy far or near yet when they come to themselves in the land where they were carried cap ve and repent and make supplica on to You in the land of those who took them cap ve saying We have sinned and done wrong we have commi ed wickedness and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who led them away cap ve and pray to You toward their land which You gave to their fathers the city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name then hear in heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplica on and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You and grant them compassion before those who took them cap ve that they may have compassion on them for they are Your people and Your inheritance whom You brought out of Egypt out of the iron furnace that Your eyes may be open to the supplica on of Your servant and the supplica on of Your people Israel to listen to them whenever they call to You
For You separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance as You spoke by Your servant Moses when You brought our fathers out of Egypt O Lord GOD
And so it was when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplica on to the LORD that he arose from before the altar of the LORD from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven
Then he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice saying Blessed be the LORD who has given rest to His people Israel according to all that He promised
There has not failed one word of all His good promise which He promised through His servant Moses
May the LORD our God be with us as He was with our fathers
May He not leave us nor forsake us that He may incline our hearts to Himself to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments which He commanded our fathers
And may these words of mine with which I have made supplica on before the LORD be near the LORD our God day and night that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel as each day may require that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God there is no other
Let your heart therefore be loyal to the LORD our God to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments as at this day
Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD
And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered to the LORD twenty two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep
So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD
On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings grain offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the fat of the peace offerings
At that me Solomon held a feast and all Israel with him a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt before the LORD our God seven days and seven more days fourteen days
On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that the LORD had done for His servant David and for Israel His people
And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king s house and all Solomon s desire which he wanted to do that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second me as He had appeared to him at Gibeon
And the LORD said to him I have heard your prayer and your supplica on that you have made before Me I have consecrated this house which you have built to put My name there forever and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually
Now if you walk before Me as your father David walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I have commanded you and if you keep My statutes and My judgments then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever as I promised David your father saying You shall not fail to have a man on the throne of Israel
But if you or your sons at all turn from following Me and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight
Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples
And as for this house which is exalted everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss and say Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house Then they will answer Because they forsook the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have embraced other gods and worshiped them and served them therefore the LORD has brought all this calamity on them
Now it happened at the end of twenty years when Solomon had built the two houses the house of the LORD and the king s house Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold as much as he desired that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty ci es in the land of Galilee
Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the ci es which Solomon had given him but they did not please him
So he said What kind of ci es are these which you have given me my brother And he called them the land of Cabul as they are to this day
Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold
And this is the reason for the labor force which King Solomon raised to build the house of the LORD his own house the Millo the wall of Jerusalem Hazor Megiddo and Gezer
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city and had given it as a dowry to his daughter Solomon s wife
And Solomon built Gezer Lower Beth Horon Baalath and Tadmor in the wilderness in the land of Judah all the storage ci es that Solomon had ci es for his chariots and ci es for his cavalry and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
All the people who were le of the Amorites Hi tes Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites who were not of the children of Israel that is their descendants who were le in the land a er them whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely from these Solomon raised forced labor as it is to this day
But of the children of Israel Solomon made no forced laborers because they were men of war and his servants his officers his captains commanders of his chariots and his cavalry
Others were chiefs of the officials who were over Solomon s work five hundred and fi y who ruled over the people who did the work
But Pharaoh s daughter came up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her
Then he built the Millo
Now three mes a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the LORD and he burned incense with them on the altar that was before the LORD
So he finished the temple
King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom
Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet seamen who knew the sea to work with the servants of Solomon
And they went to Ophir and acquired four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there and brought it to King Solomon
Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD she came to test him with hard ques ons
She came to Jerusalem with a very great re nue with camels that bore spices very much gold and precious stones and when she came to Solomon she spoke with him about all that was in her heart
So Solomon answered all her ques ons there was nothing so difficult for the king that he could not explain it to her
And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon the house that he had built the food on his table the sea ng of his servants the service of his waiters and their apparel his cupbearers and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the LORD there was no more spirit in her
Then she said to the king It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom
However I did not believe the words un l I came and saw with my own eyes and indeed the half was not told me
Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I heard
Happy are your men and happy are these your servants who stand con nually before you and hear your wisdom Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you se ng you on the throne of Israel Because the LORD has loved Israel forever therefore He made you king to do jus ce and righteousness
Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold spices in great quan ty and precious stones
There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon
Also the ships of Hiram which brought gold from Ophir brought great quan es of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir
And the king made steps of the almug wood for the house of the LORD and for the king s house also harps and stringed instruments for singers
There never again came such almug wood nor has the like been seen to this day
Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired whatever she asked besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity
So she turned and went to her own country she and her servants
The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold besides that from the traveling merchants from the income of traders from all the kings of Arabia and from the governors of the country
And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield
He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold three minas of gold went into each shield
The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold
The throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round at the back there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the armrests
Twelve lions stood there one on each side of the six steps nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom
All King Solomon s drinking vessels were gold and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold
Not one was silver for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon
For the king had merchant ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram
Once every three years the merchant ships came bringing gold silver ivory apes and monkeys
So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart
Each man brought his present ar cles of silver and gold garments armor spices horses and mules at a set rate year by year
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he sta oned in the chariot ci es and with the king in Jerusalem
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland
Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh the king s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price
Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred shekels of silver and a horse one hundred and fi y and thus through their agents they exported them to all the kings of the Hi tes and the kings of Syria
But King Solomon loved many foreign women as well as the daughter of Pharaoh women of the Moabites Ammonites Edomites Sidonians and Hi tes from the na ons of whom the LORD had said to the children of Israel You shall not intermarry with them nor they with you
Surely they will turn away your hearts a er their gods
Solomon clung to these in love
And he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart
For it was so when Solomon was old that his wives turned his heart a er other gods and his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God as was the heart of his father David
For Solomon went a er Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and a er Milcom the abomina on of the Ammonites
Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not fully follow the LORD as did his father David
Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomina on of Moab on the hill that is east of Jerusalem and for Molech the abomina on of the people of Ammon
And he did likewise for all his foreign wives who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods
So the LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned from the LORD God of Israel who had appeared to him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go a er other gods but he did not keep what the LORD had commanded
Therefore the LORD said to Solomon Because you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded you I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant
Nevertheless I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David I will tear it out of the hand of your son
However I will not tear away the whole kingdom I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen
Now the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon Hadad the Edomite he was a descendant of the king in Edom
For it happened when David was in Edom and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain a er he had killed every male in Edom because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel un l he had cut down every male in Edom that Hadad fled to go to Egypt he and certain Edomites of his father s servants with him
Hadad was s ll a li le child
Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt who gave him a house appor oned food for him and gave him land
And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife that is the sister of Queen Tahpenes
Then the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh s house
And Genubath was in Pharaoh s household among the sons of Pharaoh
So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead Hadad said to Pharaoh Let me depart that I may go to my own country
Then Pharaoh said to him But what have you lacked with me that suddenly you seek to go to your own country So he answered Nothing but do let me go anyway
And God raised up another adversary against him Rezon the son of Eliadah who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah
So he gathered men to him and became captain over a band of raiders when David killed those of Zobah
And they went to Damascus and dwelt there and reigned in Damascus
He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon besides the trouble that Hadad caused and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Syria
Then Solomon s servant Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Ephraimite from Zereda whose mother s name was Zeruah a widow also rebelled against the king
And this is what caused him to rebel against the king Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the damages to the City of David his father
The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor and Solomon seeing that the young man was industrious made him the officer over all the labor force of the house of Joseph
Now it happened at that me when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way and he had clothed himself with a new garment and the two were alone in the field
Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him and tore it into twelve pieces
And he said to Jeroboam Take for yourself ten pieces for thus says the LORD the God of Israel Behold I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel because they have forsaken Me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians Chemosh the god of the Moabites and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and keep My statutes and My judgments as did his father David
However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes
But I will take the kingdom out of his son s hand and give it to you ten tribes
And to his son I will give one tribe that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen for Myself to put My name there
So I will take you and you shall reign over all your heart desires and you shall be king over Israel
Then it shall be if you heed all that I command you walk in My ways and do what is right in My sight to keep My statutes and My commandments as My servant David did then I will be with you and build for you an enduring house as I built for David and will give Israel to you
And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this but not forever
Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam
But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt and was in Egypt un l the death of Solomon
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon all that he did and his wisdom are they not wri en in the book of the acts of Solomon And the period that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years
Then Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David his father
And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place
And Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king
So it happened when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it he was s ll in Egypt for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon and had been dwelling in Egypt that they sent and called him
Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam saying Your father made our yoke heavy now therefore lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us and we will serve you
So he said to them Depart for three days then come back to me
And the people departed
Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he s ll lived and he said How do you advise me to answer these people And they spoke to him saying If you will be a servant to these people today and serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be your servants forever
But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him who stood before him
And he said to them What advice do you give How should we answer this people who have spoken to me saying Lighten the yoke which your father put on us Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him saying Thus you should speak to this people who have spoken to you saying Your father made our yoke heavy but you make it lighter on us thus you shall say to them My li le finger shall be thicker than my father s waist And now whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you I will add to your yoke my father chas sed you with whips but I will chas se you with scourges So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day as the king had directed saying Come back to me the third day
Then the king answered the people roughly and rejected the advice which the elders had given him and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men saying My father made your yoke heavy but I will add to your yoke my father chas sed you with whips but I will chas se you with scourges So the king did not listen to the people for the turn of events was from the LORD that He might fulfill His word which the LORD had spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them the people answered the king saying What share have we in David We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse
To your tents O Israel Now see to your own house O David So Israel departed to their tents
But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the ci es of Judah
Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram who was in charge of the revenue but all Israel stoned him with stones and he died
Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day
Now it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back they sent for him and called him to the congrega on and made him king over all Israel
There was none who followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only
And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors to fight against the house of Israel that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon
But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God saying Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people saying Thus says the LORD You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel
Let every man return to his house for this thing is from Me
Therefore they obeyed the word of the LORD and turned back according to the word of the LORD
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim and dwelt there
Also he went out from there and built Penuel
And Jeroboam said in his heart Now the kingdom may return to the house of David If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord Rehoboam king of Judah and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah
Therefore the king asked advice made two calves of gold and said to the people It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem
Here are your gods O Israel which brought you up from the land of Egypt And he set up one in Bethel and the other he put in Dan
Now this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan
He made shrines on the high places and made priests from every class of people who were not of the sons of Levi
Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fi eenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah and offered sacrifices on the altar
So he did at Bethel sacrificing to the calves that he had made
And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made
So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fi eenth day of the eighth month in the month which he had devised in his own heart
And he ordained a feast for the children of Israel and offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense
And behold a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense
Then he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD and said O altar altar Thus says the LORD Behold a child Josiah by name shall be born to the house of David and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you and men s bones shall be burned on you
And he gave a sign the same day saying This is the sign which the LORD has spoken Surely the altar shall split apart and the ashes on it shall be poured out
So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God who cried out against the altar in Bethel that he stretched out his hand from the altar saying Arrest him Then his hand which he stretched out toward him withered so that he could not pull it back to himself
The altar also was split apart and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD
Then the king answered and said to the man of God Please entreat the favor of the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored to me
So the man of God entreated the LORD and the king s hand was restored to him and became as before
Then the king said to the man of God Come home with me and refresh yourself and I will give you a reward
But the man of God said to the king If you were to give me half your house I would not go in with you nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place
For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD saying You shall not eat bread nor drink water nor return by the same way you came
So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel
Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king
And their father said to them Which way did he go For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah
Then he said to his sons Saddle the donkey for me
So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode on it and went a er the man of God and found him si ng under an oak
Then he said to him Are you the man of God who came from Judah And he said I am
Then he said to him Come home with me and eat bread
And he said I cannot return with you nor go in with you neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place
For I have been told by the word of the LORD You shall not eat bread nor drink water there nor return by going the way you came
He said to him I too am a prophet as you are and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD saying Bring him back with you to your house that he may eat bread and drink water
He was lying to him
So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water
Now it happened as they sat at the table that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah saying Thus says the LORD Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you but you came back ate bread and drank water in the place of which the LORD said to you Eat no bread and drink no water your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers
So it was a er he had eaten bread and a er he had drunk that he saddled the donkey for him the prophet whom he had brought back
When he was gone a lion met him on the road and killed him
And his corpse was thrown on the road and the donkey stood by it
The lion also stood by the corpse
And there men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road and the lion standing by the corpse
Then they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt
Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it he said It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the LORD
Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion which has torn him and killed him according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him
And he spoke to his sons saying Saddle the donkey for me
So they saddled it
Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse
The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey
And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God laid it on the donkey and brought it back
So the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him
Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb and they mourned over him saying Alas my brother So it was a er he had buried him that he spoke to his sons saying When I am dead then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried lay my bones beside his bones
For the saying which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places which are in the ci es of Samaria will surely come to pass
A er this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places whoever wished he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high places
And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam so as to exterminate and destroy it from the face of the earth
At that me Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick
And Jeroboam said to his wife Please arise and disguise yourself that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam and go to Shiloh
Indeed Ahijah the prophet is there who told me that I would be king over this people
Also take with you ten loaves some cakes and a jar of honey and go to him he will tell you what will become of the child
And Jeroboam s wife did so she arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah
But Ahijah could not see for his eyes were glazed by reason of his age
Now the LORD had said to Ahijah Here is the wife of Jeroboam coming to ask you something about her son for he is sick
Thus and thus you shall say to her for it will be when she comes in that she will pretend to be another woman
And so it was when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door he said Come in wife of Jeroboam
Why do you pretend to be another person For I have been sent to you with bad news
Go tell Jeroboam Thus says the LORD God of Israel Because I exalted you from among the people and made you ruler over My people Israel and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you and yet you have not been as My servant David who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart to do only what was right in My eyes but you have done more evil than all who were before you for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger and have cast Me behind your back therefore behold I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel bond and free I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam as one takes away refuse un l it is all gone
The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field for the LORD has spoken Arise therefore go to your own house
When your feet enter the city the child shall die
And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave because in him there is found something good toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam
Moreover the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam this is the day
What Even now For the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water
He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers and will sca er them beyond the River because they have made their wooden images provoking the LORD to anger
And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam who sinned and who made Israel sin
Then Jeroboam s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah
When she came to the threshold of the house the child died
And they buried him and all Israel mourned for him according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam how he made war and how he reigned indeed they are wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
The period that Jeroboam reigned was twenty two years
So he rested with his fathers
Then Nadab his son reigned in his place
And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah
Rehoboam was forty one years old when he became king
He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there
His mother s name was Naamah an Ammonitess
Now Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they commi ed more than all that their fathers had done
For they also built for themselves high places sacred pillars and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree
And there were also perverted persons in the land
They did according to all the abomina ons of the na ons which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
It happened in the fi h year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king s house he took away everything
He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made
Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and commi ed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king s house
And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD the guards carried them then brought them back into the guardroom
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days
So Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David
His mother s name was Naamah an Ammonitess
Then Abijam his son reigned in his place
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat Abijam became king over Judah
He reigned three years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom
And he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God as was the heart of his father David
Nevertheless for David s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by se ng up his son a er him and by establishing Jerusalem because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life except in the ma er of Uriah the Hi te
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life
Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam
So Abijam rested with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David
Then Asa his son reigned in his place
In the twen eth year of Jeroboam king of Israel Asa became king over Judah
And he reigned forty one years in Jerusalem
His grandmother s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom
Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD as did his father David
And he banished the perverted persons from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made
Also he removed Maachah his grandmother from being queen mother because she had made an obscene image of Asherah
And Asa cut down her obscene image and burned it by the Brook Kidron
But the high places were not removed
Nevertheless Asa s heart was loyal to the LORD all his days
He also brought into the house of the LORD the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he himself had dedicated silver and gold and utensils
Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah
Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was le in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king s house and delivered them into the hand of his servants
And King Asa sent them to Ben Hadad the son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion king of Syria who dwelt in Damascus saying Let there be a treaty between you and me as there was between my father and your father
See I have sent you a present of silver and gold
Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me
So Ben Hadad heeded King Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the ci es of Israel
He a acked Ijon Dan Abel Beth Maachah and all Chinneroth with all the land of Naphtali
Now it happened when Baasha heard it that he stopped building Ramah and remained in Tirzah
Then King Asa made a proclama on throughout all Judah none was exempted
And they took away the stones and mber of Ramah which Baasha had used for building and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah
The rest of all the acts of Asa all his might all that he did and the ci es which he built are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah But in the me of his old age he was diseased in his feet
So Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father
Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place
Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and he reigned over Israel two years
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin
Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him
And Baasha killed him at Gibbethon which belonged to the Philis nes while Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon
Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place
And it was so when he became king that he killed all the house of Jeroboam
He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed un l he had destroyed him according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite because of the sins of Jeroboam which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin because of his provoca on with which he had provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger
Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah and reigned twenty four years
He did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin
Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha saying Inasmuch as I li ed you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin to provoke Me to anger with their sins surely I will take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat
The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Baasha and dies in the city and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the fields
Now the rest of the acts of Baasha what he did and his might are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel So Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah
Then Elah his son reigned in his place
And also the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of Jeroboam and because he killed them
In the twenty sixth year of Asa king of Judah Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel and reigned two years in Tirzah
Now his servant Zimri commander of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah
And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty seventh year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place
Then it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he was seated on his throne that he killed all the household of Baasha he did not leave him one male neither of his rela ves nor of his friends
Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha according to the word of the LORD which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols
Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel In the twenty seventh year of Asa king of Judah Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days
And the people were encamped against Gibbethon which belonged to the Philis nes
Now the people who were encamped heard it said Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king
So all Israel made Omri the commander of the army king over Israel that day in the camp
Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and they besieged Tirzah
And it happened when Zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the citadel of the king s house and burned the king s house down upon himself with fire and died because of the sins which he had commi ed in doing evil in the sight of the LORD in walking in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he had commi ed to make Israel sin
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and the treason he commi ed are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath to make him king and half followed Omri
But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath
So Tibni died and Omri reigned
In the thirty first year of Asa king of Judah Omri became king over Israel and reigned twelve years
Six years he reigned in Tirzah
And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver then he built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built Samaria a er the name of Shemer owner of the hill
Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD and did worse than all who were before him
For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols
Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and the might that he showed are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria
Then Ahab his son reigned in his place
In the thirty eighth year of Asa king of Judah Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty two years
Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him
And it came to pass as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians and he went and served Baal and worshiped him
Then he set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal which he had built in Samaria
And Ahab made a wooden image
Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him
In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho
He laid its founda on with Abiram his firstborn and with his youngest son Segub he set up its gates according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken through Joshua the son of Nun
And Elijah the Tishbite of the inhabitants of Gilead said to Ahab As the LORD God of Israel lives before whom I stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years except at my word
Then the word of the LORD came to him saying Get away from here and turn eastward and hide by the Brook Cherith which flows into the Jordan
And it will be that you shall drink from the brook and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there
So he went and did according to the word of the LORD for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith which flows into the Jordan
The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he drank from the brook
And it happened a er a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land
Then the word of the LORD came to him saying Arise go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and dwell there
See I have commanded a widow there to provide for you
So he arose and went to Zarephath
And when he came to the gate of the city indeed a widow was there gathering s cks
And he called to her and said Please bring me a li le water in a cup that I may drink
And as she was going to get it he called to her and said Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand
So she said As the LORD your God lives I do not have bread only a handful of flour in a bin and a li le oil in a jar and see I am gathering a couple of s cks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son that we may eat it and die
And Elijah said to her Do not fear go and do as you have said but make me a small cake from it first and bring it to me and a erward make some for yourself and your son
For thus says the LORD God of Israel The bin of flour shall not be used up nor shall the jar of oil run dry un l the day the LORD sends rain on the earth
So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah and she and he and her household ate for many days
The bin of flour was not used up nor did the jar of oil run dry according to the word of the LORD which He spoke by Elijah
Now it happened a er these things that the son of the woman who owned the house became sick
And his sickness was so serious that there was no breath le in him
So she said to Elijah What have I to do with you O man of God Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to kill my son And he said to her Give me your son
So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his own bed
Then he cried out to the LORD and said O LORD my God have You also brought tragedy on the widow with whom I lodge by killing her son And he stretched himself out on the child three mes and cried out to the LORD and said O LORD my God I pray let this child s soul come back to him
Then the LORD heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came back to him and he revived
And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother
And Elijah said See your son lives Then the woman said to Elijah Now by this I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is the truth
And it came to pass a er many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year saying Go present yourself to Ahab and I will send rain on the earth
So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab and there was a severe famine in Samaria
And Ahab had called Obadiah who was in charge of his house
Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly
For so it was while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the LORD that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them fi y to a cave and had fed them with bread and water
And Ahab had said to Obadiah Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive so that we will not have to kill any livestock
So they divided the land between them to explore it Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself
Now as Obadiah was on his way suddenly Elijah met him and he recognized him and fell on his face and said Is that you my lord Elijah And he answered him It is I
Go tell your master Elijah is here
So he said How have I sinned that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me As the LORD your God lives there is no na on or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you and when they said He is not here he took an oath from the kingdom or na on that they could not find you
And now you say Go tell your master Elijah is here And it shall come to pass as soon as I am gone from you that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you to a place I do not know so when I go and tell Ahab and he cannot find you he will kill me
But I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth
Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD how I hid one hundred men of the LORD S prophets fi y to a cave and fed them with bread and water And now you say Go tell your master Elijah is here
He will kill me Then Elijah said As the LORD of hosts lives before whom I stand I will surely present myself to him today
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah
Then it happened when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said to him Is that you O troubler of Israel And he answered I have not troubled Israel but you and your father s house have in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals
Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel the four hundred and fi y prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel s table
So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel
And Elijah came to all the people and said How long will you falter between two opinions If the LORD is God follow Him but if Baal follow him
But the people answered him not a word
Then Elijah said to the people I alone am le a prophet of the LORD but Baal s prophets are four hundred and fi y men
Therefore let them give us two bulls and let them choose one bull for themselves cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood but put no fire under it and I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood but put no fire under it
Then you call on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the LORD and the God who answers by fire He is God
So all the people answered and said It is well spoken
Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many and call on the name of your god but put no fire under it
So they took the bull which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning even ll noon saying O Baal hear us But there was no voice no one answered
Then they leaped about the altar which they had made
And so it was at noon that Elijah mocked them and said Cry aloud for he is a god either he is medita ng or he is busy or he is on a journey or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened
So they cried aloud and cut themselves as was their custom with knives and lances un l the blood gushed out on them
And when midday was past they prophesied un l the me of the offering of the evening sacrifice
But there was no voice no one answered no one paid a en on
Then Elijah said to all the people Come near to me
So all the people came near to him
And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down
And Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the LORD had come saying Israel shall be your name
Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed
And he put the wood in order cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood and said Fill four waterpots with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood
Then he said Do it a second me and they did it a second me and he said Do it a third me and they did it a third me
So the water ran all around the altar and he also filled the trench with water
And it came to pass at the me of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said LORD God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant and that I have done all these things at Your word
Hear me O LORD hear me that this people may know that You are the LORD God and that You have turned their hearts back to You again
Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and it licked up the water that was in the trench
Now when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said The LORD He is God The LORD He is God And Elijah said to them Seize the prophets of Baal Do not let one of them escape So they seized them and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there
Then Elijah said to Ahab Go up eat and drink for there is the sound of abundance of rain
So Ahab went up to eat and drink
And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel then he bowed down on the ground and put his face between his knees and said to his servant Go up now look toward the sea
So he went up and looked and said There is nothing
And seven mes he said Go again
Then it came to pass the seventh me that he said There is a cloud as small as a man s hand rising out of the sea So he said Go up say to Ahab Prepare your chariot and go down before the rain stops you
Now it happened in the mean me that the sky became black with clouds and wind and there was a heavy rain
So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel
Then the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel
And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done also how he had executed all the prophets with the sword
Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying So let the gods do to me and more also if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this me
And when he saw that he arose and ran for his life and went to Beersheba which belongs to Judah and le his servant there
But he himself went a day s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree
And he prayed that he might die and said It is enough Now LORD take my life for I am no be er than my fathers Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree suddenly an angel touched him and said to him Arise and eat
Then he looked and there by his head was a cake baked on coals and a jar of water
So he ate and drank and lay down again
And the angel of the LORD came back the second me and touched him and said Arise and eat because the journey is too great for you
So he arose and ate and drank and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb the mountain of God
And there he went into a cave and spent the night in that place and behold the word of the LORD came to him and He said to him What are you doing here Elijah So he said I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword
I alone am le and they seek to take my life
Then He said Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD
And behold the LORD passed by and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD but the LORD was not in the wind and a er the wind an earthquake but the LORD was not in the earthquake and a er the earthquake a fire but the LORD was not in the fire and a er the fire a s ll small voice
So it was when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave
Suddenly a voice came to him and said What are you doing here Elijah And he said I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword
I alone am le and they seek to take my life
Then the LORD said to him Go return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when you arrive anoint Hazael as king over Syria
Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel
And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place
It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael Jehu will kill and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu Elisha will kill
Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel all whose knees have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him
So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he was with the twel h
Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him
And he le the oxen and ran a er Elijah and said Please let me kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow you
And he said to him Go back again for what have I done to you So Elisha turned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh using the oxen s equipment and gave it to the people and they ate
Then he arose and followed Elijah and became his servant
Now Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together thirty two kings were with him with horses and chariots
And he went up and besieged Samaria and made war against it
Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him Thus says Ben Hadad Your silver and your gold are mine your loveliest wives and children are mine
And the king of Israel answered and said My lord O king just as you say I and all that I have are yours
Then the messengers came back and said Thus speaks Ben Hadad saying Indeed I have sent to you saying You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold your wives and your children but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this me and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants
And it shall be that whatever is pleasant in your eyes they will put it in their hands and take it
So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said No ce please and see how this man seeks trouble for he sent to me for my wives my children my silver and my gold and I did not deny him
And all the elders and all the people said to him Do not listen or consent
Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad Tell my lord the king All that you sent for to your servant the first me I will do but this thing I cannot do
And the messengers departed and brought back word to him
Then Ben Hadad sent to him and said The gods do so to me and more also if enough dust is le of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me
So the king of Israel answered and said Tell him Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off
And it happened when Ben Hadad heard this message as he and the kings were drinking at the command post that he said to his servants Get ready
And they got ready to a ack the city
Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel saying Thus says the LORD Have you seen all this great mul tude Behold I will deliver it into your hand today and you shall know that I am the LORD
So Ahab said By whom And he said Thus says the LORD By the young leaders of the provinces
Then he said Who will set the ba le in order And he answered You
Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces and there were two hundred and thirty two and a er them he mustered all the people all the children of Israel seven thousand
So they went out at noon
Meanwhile Ben Hadad and the thirty two kings helping him were ge ng drunk at the command post
The young leaders of the provinces went out first
And Ben Hadad sent out a patrol and they told him saying Men are coming out of Samaria So he said If they have come out for peace take them alive and if they have come out for war take them alive
Then these young leaders of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them
And each one killed his man so the Syrians fled and Israel pursued them and Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry
Then the king of Israel went out and a acked the horses and chariots and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter
And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him Go strengthen yourself take note and see what you should do for in the spring of the year the king of Syria will come up against you
Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him Their gods are gods of the hills
Therefore they were stronger than we but if we fight against them in the plain surely we will be stronger than they
So do this thing Dismiss the kings each from his posi on and put captains in their places and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot
Then we will fight against them in the plain surely we will be stronger than they
And he listened to their voice and did so
So it was in the spring of the year that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel
And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions and they went against them
Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two li le flocks of goats while the Syrians filled the countryside
Then a man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel and said Thus says the LORD Because the Syrians have said The LORD is God of the hills but He is not God of the valleys therefore I will deliver all this great mul tude into your hand and you shall know that I am the LORD
And they encamped opposite each other for seven days
So it was that on the seventh day the ba le was joined and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day
But the rest fled to Aphek into the city then a wall fell on twenty seven thousand of the men who were le
And Ben Hadad fled and went into the city into an inner chamber
Then his servants said to him Look now we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings
Please let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads and go out to the king of Israel perhaps he will spare your life
So they wore sackcloth around their waists and put ropes around their heads and came to the king of Israel and said Your servant Ben Hadad says Please let me live
And he said Is he s ll alive He is my brother
Now the men were watching closely to see whether any sign of mercy would come from him and they quickly grasped at this word and said Your brother Ben Hadad
So he said Go bring him
Then Ben Hadad came out to him and he had him come up into the chariot
So Ben Hadad said to him The ci es which my father took from your father I will restore and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria
Then Ahab said I will send you away with this treaty
So he made a treaty with him and sent him away
Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the LORD Strike me please
And the man refused to strike him
Then he said to him Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD surely as soon as you depart from me a lion shall kill you
And as soon as he le him a lion found him and killed him
And he found another man and said Strike me please
So the man struck him inflic ng a wound
Then the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes
Now as the king passed by he cried out to the king and said Your servant went out into the midst of the ba le and there a man came over and brought a man to me and said Guard this man if by any means he is missing your life shall be for his life or else you shall pay a talent of silver
While your servant was busy here and there he was gone
Then the king of Israel said to him So shall your judgment be you yourself have decided it
And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets
Then he said to him Thus says the LORD Because you have let slip out of your hand a man whom I appointed to u er destruc on therefore your life shall go for his life and your people for his people
So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased and came to Samaria
And it came to pass a er these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria
So Ahab spoke to Naboth saying Give me your vineyard that I may have it for a vegetable garden because it is near next to my house and for it I will give you a vineyard be er than it
Or if it seems good to you I will give you its worth in money
But Naboth said to Ahab The LORD forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers
And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food
But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food He said to her Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him Give me your vineyard for money or else if it pleases you I will give you another vineyard for it
And he answered I will not give you my vineyard
Then Jezebel his wife said to him You now exercise authority over Israel Arise eat food and let your heart be cheerful I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite
And she wrote le ers in Ahab s name sealed them with his seal and sent the le ers to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth
She wrote in the le ers saying Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth with high honor among the people and seat two men scoundrels before him to bear witness against him saying You have blasphemed God and the king
Then take him out and stone him that he may die
So the men of his city the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city did as Jezebel had sent to them as it was wri en in the le ers which she had sent to them
They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth with high honor among the people
And two men scoundrels came in and sat before him and the scoundrels witnessed against him against Naboth in the presence of the people saying Naboth has blasphemed God and the king Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones so that he died
Then they sent to Jezebel saying Naboth has been stoned and is dead
And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead that Jezebel said to Ahab Arise take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to give you for money for Naboth is not alive but dead
So it was when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite
Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite saying Arise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel who lives in Samaria
There he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it
You shall speak to him saying Thus says the LORD Have you murdered and also taken possession And you shall speak to him saying Thus says the LORD In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth dogs shall lick your blood even yours
So Ahab said to Elijah Have you found me O my enemy And he answered I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD Behold I will bring calamity on you
I will take away your posterity and will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel both bond and free
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah because of the provoca on with which you have provoked Me to anger and made Israel sin
And concerning Jezebel the LORD also spoke saying The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel
The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field
But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the LORD because Jezebel his wife s rred him up
And he behaved very abominably in following idols according to all that the Amorites had done whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
So it was when Ahab heard those words that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his body and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went about mourning
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite saying See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me Because he has humbled himself before Me I will not bring the calamity in his days
In the days of his son I will bring the calamity on his house
Now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel
Then it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel
And the king of Israel said to his servants Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours but we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria So he said to Jehoshaphat Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses
Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel Please inquire for the word of the LORD today
Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said to them Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight or shall I refrain So they said Go up for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king
And Jehoshaphat said Is there not s ll a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of Him So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is s ll one man Micaiah the son of Imlah by whom we may inquire of the LORD but I hate him because he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil
And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say such things Then the king of Israel called an officer and said Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah having put on their robes sat each on his throne at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself and he said Thus says the LORD With these you shall gore the Syrians un l they are destroyed
And all the prophets prophesied so saying Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper for the LORD will deliver it into the king s hand
Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him saying Now listen the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king
Please let your word be like the word of one of them and speak encouragement
And Micaiah said As the LORD lives whatever the LORD says to me that I will speak
Then he came to the king and the king said to him Micaiah shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead or shall we refrain And he answered him Go and prosper for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king So the king said to him How many mes shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD Then he said I saw all Israel sca ered on the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd
And the LORD said These have no master
Let each return to his house in peace
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil Then Micaiah said Therefore hear the word of the LORD I saw the LORD si ng on His throne and all the host of heaven standing by on His right hand and on His le
And the LORD said Who will persuade Ahab to go up that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead So one spoke in this manner and another spoke in that manner
Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said I will persuade him
The LORD said to him In what way So he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
And the LORD said You shall persuade him and also prevail
Go out and do so
Therefore look The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours and the LORD has declared disaster against you
Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you And Micaiah said Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide So the king of Israel said Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king s son and say Thus says the king Put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread of afflic on and water of afflic on un l I come in peace
But Micaiah said If you ever return in peace the LORD has not spoken by me
And he said Take heed all you people So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat I will disguise myself and go into ba le but you put on your robes
So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into ba le
Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty two captains of his chariots saying Fight with no one small or great but only with the king of Israel
So it was when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said Surely it is the king of Israel Therefore they turned aside to fight against him and Jehoshaphat cried out
And it happened when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel that they turned back from pursuing him
Now a certain man drew a bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor
So he said to the driver of his chariot Turn around and take me out of the ba le for I am wounded
The ba le increased that day and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians and died at evening
The blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot
Then as the sun was going down a shout went throughout the army saying Every man to his city and every man to his own country So the king died and was brought to Samaria
And they buried the king in Samaria
Then someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria and the dogs licked up his blood while the harlots bathed according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did the ivory house which he built and all the ci es that he built are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel So Ahab rested with his fathers
Then Ahaziah his son reigned in his place
Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel
Jehoshaphat was thirty five years old when he became king and he reigned twenty five years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa
He did not turn aside from them doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD
Nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places
Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat the might that he showed and how he made war are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah And the rest of the perverted persons who remained in the days of his father Asa he banished from the land
There was then no king in Edom only a deputy of the king
Jehoshaphat made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold but they never sailed for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber
Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat Let my servants go with your servants in the ships
But Jehoshaphat would not
And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father
Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place
Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned two years over Israel
He did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who had made Israel sin for he served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger according to all that his father had done
Kings Moab rebelled against Israel a er the death of Ahab
Now Ahaziah fell through the la ce of his upper room in Samaria and was injured so he sent messengers and said to them Go inquire of Baal Zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover from this injury
But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite Arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal Zebub the god of Ekron Now therefore thus says the LORD You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up but you shall surely die
So Elijah departed
And when the messengers returned to him he said to them Why have you come back So they said to him A man came up to meet us and said to us Go return to the king who sent you and say to him Thus says the LORD Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal Zebub the god of Ekron Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up but you shall surely die
Then he said to them What kind of man was it who came up to meet you and told you these words So they answered him A hairy man wearing a leather belt around his waist
And he said It is Elijah the Tishbite
Then the king sent to him a captain of fi y with his fi y men
So he went up to him and there he was si ng on the top of a hill
And he spoke to him Man of God the king has said Come down So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fi y If I am a man of God then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fi y men
And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fi y
Then he sent to him another captain of fi y with his fi y men
And he answered and said to him Man of God thus has the king said Come down quickly So Elijah answered and said to them If I am a man of God let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fi y men
And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fi y
Again he sent a third captain of fi y with his fi y men
And the third captain of fi y went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and pleaded with him and said to him Man of God please let my life and the life of these fi y servants of yours be precious in your sight
Look fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fi ies with their fi ies
But let my life now be precious in your sight
And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah Go down with him do not be afraid of him
So he arose and went down with him to the king
Then he said to him Thus says the LORD Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub the god of Ekron is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up but you shall surely die
So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken
Because he had no son Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel And it came to pass when the LORD was about to take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal
Then Elijah said to Elisha Stay here please for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel
But Elisha said As the LORD lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you So they went down to Bethel
Now the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today And he said Yes I know keep silent Then Elijah said to him Elisha stay here please for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho
But he said As the LORD lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you So they came to Jericho
Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today So he answered Yes I know keep silent Then Elijah said to him Stay here please for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan
But he said As the LORD lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you So the two of them went on
And fi y men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan
Now Elijah took his mantle rolled it up and struck the water and it was divided this way and that so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground
And so it was when they had crossed over that Elijah said to Elisha Ask What may I do for you before I am taken away from you Elisha said Please let a double por on of your spirit be upon me
So he said You have asked a hard thing
Nevertheless if you see me when I am taken from you it shall be so for you but if not it shall not be so
Then it happened as they con nued on and talked that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire and separated the two of them and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven
And Elisha saw it and he cried out My father my father the chariot of Israel and its horsemen So he saw him no more
And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces
He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan
Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water and said Where is the LORD God of Elijah And when he also had struck the water it was divided this way and that and Elisha crossed over
Now when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him they said The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha
And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him
Then they said to him Look now there are fi y strong men with your servants
Please let them go and search for your master lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley
And he said You shall not send anyone
But when they urged him ll he was ashamed he said Send them Therefore they sent fi y men and they searched for three days but did not find him
And when they came back to him for he had stayed in Jericho he said to them Did I not say to you Do not go Then the men of the city said to Elisha Please no ce the situa on of this city is pleasant as my lord sees but the water is bad and the ground barren
And he said Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it
So they brought it to him
Then he went out to the source of the water and cast in the salt there and said Thus says the LORD I have healed this water from it there shall be no more death or barrenness
So the water remains healed to this day according to the word of Elisha which he spoke
Then he went up from there to Bethel and as he was going up the road some youths came from the city and mocked him and said to him Go up you baldhead Go up you baldhead So he turned around and looked at them and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD
And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty two of the youths
Then he went from there to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria
Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned twelve years
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD but not like his father and mother for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made
Nevertheless he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who had made Israel sin he did not depart from them
Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams
But it happened when Ahab died that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel
So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that me and mustered all Israel
Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah saying The king of Moab has rebelled against me
Will you go with me to fight against Moab And he said I will go up I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses
Then he said Which way shall we go up And he answered By way of the Wilderness of Edom
So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom and they marched on that roundabout route seven days and there was no water for the army nor for the animals that followed them
And the king of Israel said Alas For the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab
But Jehoshaphat said Is there no prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of the LORD by him So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said Elisha the son of Shaphat is here who poured water on the hands of Elijah
And Jehoshaphat said The word of the LORD is with him
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him
Then Elisha said to the king of Israel What have I to do with you Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother
But the king of Israel said to him No for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab
And Elisha said As the LORD of hosts lives before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I would not look at you nor see you
But now bring me a musician
Then it happened when the musician played that the hand of the LORD came upon him
And he said Thus says the LORD Make this valley full of ditches
For thus says the LORD You shall not see wind nor shall you see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water so that you your ca le and your animals may drink
And this is a simple ma er in the sight of the LORD He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand
Also you shall a ack every for fied city and every choice city and shall cut down every good tree and stop up every spring of water and ruin every good piece of land with stones
Now it happened in the morning when the grain offering was offered that suddenly water came by way of Edom and the land was filled with water
And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered and they stood at the border
Then they rose up early in the morning and the sun was shining on the water and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood
And they said This is blood the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another now therefore Moab to the spoil So when they came to the camp of Israel Israel rose up and a acked the Moabites so that they fled before them and they entered their land killing the Moabites
Then they destroyed the ci es and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees
But they le the stones of Kir Haraseth intact
However the slingers surrounded and a acked it
And when the king of Moab saw that the ba le was too fierce for him he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords to break through to the king of Edom but they could not
Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall and there was great indigna on against Israel
So they departed from him and returned to their own land
A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha saying Your servant my husband is dead and you know that your servant feared the LORD
And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves
So Elisha said to her What shall I do for you Tell me what do you have in the house And she said Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil
Then he said Go borrow vessels from everywhere from all your neighbors empty vessels do not gather just a few
And when you have come in you shall shut the door behind you and your sons then pour it into all those vessels and set aside the full ones
So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured it out
Now it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said to her son Bring me another vessel
And he said to her There is not another vessel
So the oil ceased
Then she came and told the man of God
And he said Go sell the oil and pay your debt and you and your sons live on the rest
Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem where there was a notable woman and she persuaded him to eat some food
So it was as o en as he passed by he would turn in there to eat some food
And she said to her husband Look now I know that this is a holy man of God who passes by us regularly
Please let us make a small upper room on the wall and let us put a bed for him there and a table and a chair and a lampstand so it will be whenever he comes to us he can turn in there
And it happened one day that he came there and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there
Then he said to Gehazi his servant Call this Shunammite woman
When he had called her she stood before him
And he said to him Say now to her Look you have been concerned for us with all this care
What can I do for you Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army She answered I dwell among my own people
So he said What then is to be done for her And Gehazi answered Actually she has no son and her husband is old
So he said Call her
When he had called her she stood in the doorway
Then he said About this me next year you shall embrace a son
And she said No my lord
Man of God do not lie to your maidservant But the woman conceived and bore a son when the appointed me had come of which Elisha had told her
And the child grew
Now it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers
And he said to his father My head my head So he said to a servant Carry him to his mother
When he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees ll noon and then died
And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God shut the door upon him and went out
Then she called to her husband and said Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys that I may run to the man of God and come back
So he said Why are you going to him today It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath
And she said It is well
Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant Drive and go forward do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you
And so she departed and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel
So it was when the man of God saw her afar off that he said to his servant Gehazi Look the Shunammite woman
Please run now to meet her and say to her Is it well with you Is it well with your husband Is it well with the child And she answered It is well
Now when she came to the man of God at the hill she caught him by the feet but Gehazi came near to push her away
But the man of God said Let her alone for her soul is in deep distress and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me
So she said Did I ask a son of my lord Did I not say Do not deceive me Then he said to Gehazi Get yourself ready and take my staff in your hand and be on your way
If you meet anyone do not greet him and if anyone greets you do not answer him but lay my staff on the face of the child
And the mother of the child said As the LORD lives and as your soul lives I will not leave you
So he arose and followed her
Now Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing
Therefore he went back to meet him and told him saying The child has not awakened
When Elisha came into the house there was the child lying dead on his bed
He went in therefore shut the door behind the two of them and prayed to the LORD
And he went up and lay on the child and put his mouth on his mouth his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands and he stretched himself out on the child and the flesh of the child became warm
He returned and walked back and forth in the house and again went up and stretched himself out on him then the child sneezed seven mes and the child opened his eyes
And he called Gehazi and said Call this Shunammite woman
So he called her
And when she came in to him he said Pick up your son
So she went in fell at his feet and bowed to the ground then she picked up her son and went out
And Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in the land
Now the sons of the prophets were si ng before him and he said to his servant Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets
So one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds and came and sliced them into the pot of stew though they did not know what they were
Then they served it to the men to eat
Now it happened as they were ea ng the stew that they cried out and said Man of God there is death in the pot And they could not eat it
So he said Then bring some flour
And he put it into the pot and said Serve it to the people that they may eat
And there was nothing harmful in the pot
Then a man came from Baal Shalisha and brought the man of God bread of the firs ruits twenty loaves of barley bread and newly ripened grain in his knapsack
And he said Give it to the people that they may eat
But his servant said What Shall I set this before one hundred men He said again Give it to the people that they may eat for thus says the LORD They shall eat and have some le over
So he set it before them and they ate and had some le over according to the word of the LORD
Now Naaman commander of the army of the king of Syria was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria
He was also a mighty man of valor but a leper
And the Syrians had gone out on raids and had brought back cap ve a young girl from the land of Israel
She waited on Naaman s wife
Then she said to her mistress If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria For he would heal him of his leprosy
And Naaman went in and told his master saying Thus and thus said the girl who is from the land of Israel
Then the king of Syria said Go now and I will send a le er to the king of Israel
So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothing
Then he brought the le er to the king of Israel which said Now be advised when this le er comes to you that I have sent Naaman my servant to you that you may heal him of his leprosy
And it happened when the king of Israel read the le er that he tore his clothes and said Am I God to kill and make alive that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy Therefore please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel with me
So it was when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes that he sent to the king saying Why have you torn your clothes Please let him come to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel
Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot and he stood at the door of Elisha s house
And Elisha sent a messenger to him saying Go and wash in the Jordan seven mes and your flesh shall be restored to you and you shall be clean
But Naaman became furious and went away and said Indeed I said to myself He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God and wave his hand over the place and heal the leprosy
Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar the rivers of Damascus be er than all the waters of Israel Could I not wash in them and be clean So he turned and went away in a rage
And his servants came near and spoke to him and said My father if the prophet had told you to do something great would you not have done it How much more then when he says to you Wash and be clean So he went down and dipped seven mes in the Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a li le child and he was clean
And he returned to the man of God he and all his aides and came and stood before him and he said Indeed now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel now therefore please take a gi from your servant
But he said As the LORD lives before whom I stand I will receive nothing
And he urged him to take it but he refused
So Naaman said Then if not please let your servant be given two mule loads of earth for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods but to the LORD
Yet in this thing may the LORD pardon your servant when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there and he leans on my hand and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon may the LORD please pardon your servant in this thing
Then he said to him Go in peace
So he departed from him a short distance
But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said Look my master has spared Naaman this Syrian while not receiving from his hands what he brought but as the LORD lives I will run a er him and take something from him
So Gehazi pursued Naaman
When Naaman saw him running a er him he got down from the chariot to meet him and said Is all well And he said All is well
My master has sent me saying Indeed just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim
Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments
So Naaman said Please take two talents
And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and handed them to two of his servants and they carried them on ahead of him
When he came to the citadel he took them from their hand and stored them away in the house then he let the men go and they departed
Now he went in and stood before his master
Elisha said to him Where did you go Gehazi And he said Your servant did not go anywhere
Then he said to him Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you Is it me to receive money and to receive clothing olive groves and vineyards sheep and oxen male and female servants Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever
And he went out from his presence leprous as white as snow
And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha See now the place where we dwell with you is too small for us
Please let us go to the Jordan and let every man take a beam from there and let us make there a place where we may dwell
So he answered Go
Then one said Please consent to go with your servants
And he answered I will go
So he went with them
And when they came to the Jordan they cut down trees
But as one was cu ng down a tree the iron ax head fell into the water and he cried out and said Alas master For it was borrowed
So the man of God said Where did it fall And he showed him the place
So he cut off a s ck and threw it in there and he made the iron float
Therefore he said Pick it up for yourself
So he reached out his hand and took it
Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel and he consulted with his servants saying My camp will be in such and such a place
And the man of God sent to the king of Israel saying Beware that you do not pass this place for the Syrians are coming down there
Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him
Thus he warned him and he was watchful there not just once or twice
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing and he called his servants and said to them Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel And one of his servants said None my lord O king but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom
So he said Go and see where he is that I may send and get him
And it was told him saying Surely he is in Dothan
Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there and they came by night and surrounded the city
And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out there was an army surrounding the city with horses and chariots
And his servant said to him Alas my master What shall we do So he answered Do not fear for those who are with us are more than those who are with them
And Elisha prayed and said LORD I pray open his eyes that he may see
Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man and he saw
And behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha
So when the Syrians came down to him Elisha prayed to the LORD and said Strike this people I pray with blindness
And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha
Now Elisha said to them This is not the way nor is this the city
Follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek
But he led them to Samaria
So it was when they had come to Samaria that Elisha said LORD open the eyes of these men that they may see
And the LORD opened their eyes and they saw and there they were inside Samaria Now when the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha My father shall I kill them Shall I kill them But he answered You shall not kill them
Would you kill those whom you have taken cap ve with your sword and your bow Set food and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master
Then he prepared a great feast for them and a er they ate and drank he sent them away and they went to their master
So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel
And it happened a er this that Ben Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria
And there was a great famine in Samaria and indeed they besieged it un l a donkey s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver and one fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver
Then as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him saying Help my lord O king And he said If the LORD does not help you where can I find help for you From the threshing floor or from the winepress Then the king said to her What is troubling you And she answered This woman said to me Give your son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow
So we boiled my son and ate him
And I said to her on the next day Give your son that we may eat him but she has hidden her son
Now it happened when the king heard the words of the woman that he tore his clothes and as he passed by on the wall the people looked and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body
Then he said God do so to me and more also if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today
But Elisha was si ng in his house and the elders were si ng with him
And the king sent a man ahead of him but before the messenger came to him he said to the elders Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head Look when the messenger comes shut the door and hold him fast at the door
Is not the sound of his master s feet behind him And while he was s ll talking with them there was the messenger coming down to him and then the king said Surely this calamity is from the LORD why should I wait for the LORD any longer Then Elisha said Hear the word of the LORD
Thus says the LORD Tomorrow about this me a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria
So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said Look if the LORD would make windows in heaven could this thing be And he said In fact you shall see it with your eyes but you shall not eat of it
Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate and they said to one another Why are we si ng here un l we die If we say We will enter the city the famine is in the city and we shall die there
And if we sit here we die also
Now therefore come let us surrender to the army of the Syrians
If they keep us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall only die
And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp to their surprise no one was there
For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses the noise of a great army so they said to one another Look the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hi tes and the kings of the Egyp ans to a ack us Therefore they arose and fled at twilight and le the camp intact their tents their horses and their donkeys and they fled for their lives
And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp they went into one tent and ate and drank and carried from it silver and gold and clothing and went and hid them then they came back and entered another tent and carried some from there also and went and hid it
Then they said to one another We are not doing right
This day is a day of good news and we remain silent
If we wait un l morning light some punishment will come upon us
Now therefore come let us go and tell the king s household
So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them saying We went to the Syrian camp and surprisingly no one was there not a human sound only horses and donkeys ed and the tents intact
And the gatekeepers called out and they told it to the king s household inside
So the king arose in the night and said to his servants Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us
They know that we are hungry therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying When they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city
And one of his servants answered and said Please let several men take five of the remaining horses which are le in the city
Look they may either become like all the mul tude of Israel that are le in it or indeed I say they may become like all the mul tude of Israel le from those who are consumed so let us send them and see
Therefore they took two chariots with horses and the king sent them in the direc on of the Syrian army saying Go and see
And they went a er them to the Jordan and indeed all the road was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste
So the messengers returned and told the king
Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians
So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel according to the word of the LORD
Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate
But the people trampled him in the gate and he died just as the man of God had said who spoke when the king came down to him
So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king saying Two seahs of barley for a shekel and a seah of fine flour for a shekel shall be sold tomorrow about this me in the gate of Samaria
Then that officer had answered the man of God and said Now look if the LORD would make windows in heaven could such a thing be And he had said In fact you shall see it with your eyes but you shall not eat of it
And so it happened to him for the people trampled him in the gate and he died
Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life saying Arise and go you and your household and stay wherever you can for the LORD has called for a famine and furthermore it will come upon the land for seven years
So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philis nes seven years
It came to pass at the end of seven years that the woman returned from the land of the Philis nes and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land
Then the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God saying Tell me please all the great things Elisha has done
Now it happened as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life that there was the woman whose son he had restored to life appealing to the king for her house and for her land
And Gehazi said My lord O king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life
And when the king asked the woman she told him
So the king appointed a certain officer for her saying Restore all that was hers and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she le the land un l now
Then Elisha went to Damascus and Ben Hadad king of Syria was sick and it was told him saying The man of God has come here
And the king said to Hazael Take a present in your hand and go to meet the man of God and inquire of the LORD by him saying Shall I recover from this disease So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him of every good thing of Damascus forty camel loads and he came and stood before him and said Your son Ben Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you saying Shall I recover from this disease And Elisha said to him Go say to him You shall certainly recover
However the LORD has shown me that he will really die
Then he set his countenance in a stare un l he was ashamed and the man of God wept
And Hazael said Why is my lord weeping He answered Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel Their strongholds you will set on fire and their young men you will kill with the sword and you will dash their children and rip open their women with child
So Hazael said But what is your servant a dog that he should do this gross thing And Elisha answered The LORD has shown me that you will become king over Syria
Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master who said to him What did Elisha say to you And he answered He told me you would surely recover
But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it over his face so that he died and Hazael reigned in his place
Now in the fi h year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat having been king of Judah Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah
He was thirty two years old when he became king and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel just as the house of Ahab had done for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the LORD
Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for the sake of his servant David as He promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons forever
In his days Edom revolted against Judah s authority and made a king over themselves
So Joram went to Zair and all his chariots with him
Then he rose by night and a acked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots and the troops fled to their tents
Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah s authority to this day
And Libnah revolted at that me
Now the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah So Joram rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David
Then Ahaziah his son reigned in his place
In the twel h year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign
Ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned one year in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel
And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab
Now he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead and the Syrians wounded Joram
Then King Joram went back to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria
And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick
And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him Get yourself ready take this flask of oil in your hand and go to Ramoth Gilead
Now when you arrive at that place look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi and go in and make him rise up from among his associates and take him to an inner room
Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say Thus says the LORD I have anointed you king over Israel
Then open the door and flee and do not delay
So the young man the servant of the prophet went to Ramoth Gilead
And when he arrived there were the captains of the army si ng and he said I have a message for you Commander
Jehu said For which one of us And he said For you Commander
Then he arose and went into the house
And he poured the oil on his head and said to him Thus says the LORD God of Israel I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD over Israel
You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the LORD at the hand of Jezebel
For the whole house of Ahab shall perish and I will cut off from Ahab all the males in Israel both bond and free
So I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah
The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot of ground at Jezreel and there shall be none to bury her
And he opened the door and fled
Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master and one said to him Is all well Why did this madman come to you And he said to them You know the man and his babble
And they said A lie Tell us now
So he said Thus and thus he spoke to me saying Thus says the LORD I have anointed you king over Israel
Then each man hastened to take his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps and they blew trumpets saying Jehu is king So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram
Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead he and all Israel against Hazael king of Syria
But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria
And Jehu said If you are so minded let no one leave or escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel
So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel for Joram was laid up there and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram
Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came and said I see a company of men
And Joram said Get a horseman and send him to meet them and let him say Is it peace So the horseman went to meet him and said Thus says the king Is it peace And Jehu said What have you to do with peace Turn around and follow me
So the watchman reported saying The messenger went to them but is not coming back
Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them and said Thus says the king Is it peace And Jehu answered What have you to do with peace Turn around and follow me
So the watchman reported saying He went up to them and is not coming back and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi for he drives furiously Then Joram said Make ready
And his chariot was made ready
Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out each in his chariot and they went out to meet Jehu and met him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite
Now it happened when Joram saw Jehu that he said Is it peace Jehu So he answered What peace as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcra are so many Then Joram turned around and fled and said to Ahaziah Treachery Ahaziah Now Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms and the arrow came out at his heart and he sank down in his chariot
Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain Pick him up and throw him into the tract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite for remember when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father that the LORD laid this burden upon him Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons says the LORD and I will repay you in this plot says the LORD
Now therefore take and throw him on the plot of ground according to the word of the LORD
But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw this he fled by the road to Beth Haggan
So Jehu pursued him and said Shoot him also in the chariot
And they shot him at the Ascent of Gur which is by Ibleam
Then he fled to Megiddo and died there
And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David
In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab Ahaziah had become king over Judah
Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she put paint on her eyes and adorned her head and looked through a window
Then as Jehu entered at the gate she said Is it peace Zimri murderer of your master And he looked up at the window and said Who is on my side Who So two or three eunuchs looked out at him
Then he said Throw her down
So they threw her down and some of her blood spa ered on the wall and on the horses and he trampled her underfoot
And when he had gone in he ate and drank
Then he said Go now see to this accursed woman and bury her for she was a king s daughter
So they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands
Therefore they came back and told him
And he said This is the word of the LORD which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite saying On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as refuse on the surface of the field in the plot at Jezreel so that they shall not say Here lies Jezebel
Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria
And Jehu wrote and sent le ers to Samaria to the rulers of Jezreel to the elders and to those who reared Ahab s sons saying Now as soon as this le er comes to you since your master s sons are with you and you have chariots and horses a for fied city also and weapons choose the best qualified of your master s sons set him on his father s throne and fight for your master s house
But they were exceedingly afraid and said Look two kings could not stand up to him how then can we stand And he who was in charge of the house and he who was in charge of the city the elders also and those who reared the sons sent to Jehu saying We are your servants we will do all you tell us but we will not make anyone king
Do what is good in your sight
Then he wrote a second le er to them saying If you are for me and will obey my voice take the heads of the men your master s sons and come to me at Jezreel by this me tomorrow
Now the king s sons seventy persons were with the great men of the city who were rearing them
So it was when the le er came to them that they took the king s sons and slaughtered seventy persons put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel
Then a messenger came and told him saying They have brought the heads of the king s sons
And he said Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate un l morning
So it was in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people You are righteous
Indeed I conspired against my master and killed him but who killed all these Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of the LORD which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab for the LORD has done what He spoke by His servant Elijah
So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests un l he le him none remaining
And he arose and departed and went to Samaria
On the way at Beth Eked of the Shepherds Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah and said Who are you So they answered We are the brothers of Ahaziah we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother
And he said Take them alive So they took them alive and killed them at the well of Beth Eked forty two men and he le none of them
Now when he departed from there he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him and he greeted him and said to him Is your heart right as my heart is toward your heart And Jehonadab answered It is
Jehu said If it is give me your hand
So he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot
Then he said Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD
So they had him ride in his chariot
And when he came to Samaria he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria ll he had destroyed them according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah
Then Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them Ahab served Baal a li le Jehu will serve him much
Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal all his servants and all his priests
Let no one be missing for I have a great sacrifice for Baal
Whoever is missing shall not live
But Jehu acted decep vely with the intent of destroying the worshipers of Baal
And Jehu said Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal
So they proclaimed it
Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel and all the worshipers of Baal came so that there was not a man le who did not come
So they came into the temple of Baal and the temple of Baal was full from one end to the other
And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal
So he brought out vestments for them
Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal and said to the worshipers of Baal Search and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you but only the worshipers of Baal
So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings
Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men on the outside and had said If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes whoever lets him escape it shall be his life for the life of the other
Now it happened as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains Go in and kill them let no one come out And they killed them with the edge of the sword then the guards and the officers threw them out and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal
And they brought the sacred pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them
Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal and made it a refuse dump to this day
Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel
However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who had made Israel sin that is from the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan
And the LORD said to Jehu Because you have done well in doing what is right in My sight and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth genera on
But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam who had made Israel sin
In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel and Hazael conquered them in all the territory of Israel from the Jordan eastward all the land of Gilead Gad Reuben and Manasseh from Aroer which is by the River Arnon including Gilead and Bashan
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu all that he did and all his might are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel So Jehu rested with his fathers and they buried him in Samaria
Then Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place
And the period that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty eight years
When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs
But Jehosheba the daughter of King Joram sister of Ahaziah took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king s sons who were being murdered and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom from Athaliah so that he was not killed
So he was hidden with her in the house of the LORD for six years while Athaliah reigned over the land
In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds of the bodyguards and the escorts and brought them into the house of the LORD to him
And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the LORD and showed them the king s son
Then he commanded them saying This is what you shall do One third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king s house one third shall be at the gate of Sur and one third at the gate behind the escorts
You shall keep the watch of the house lest it be broken down
The two con ngents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD for the king
But you shall surround the king on all sides every man with his weapons in his hand and whoever comes within range let him be put to death
You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in
So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded
Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath and came to Jehoiada the priest
And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David that were in the temple of the LORD
Then the escorts stood every man with his weapons in his hand all around the king from the right side of the temple to the le side of the temple by the altar and the house
And he brought out the king s son put the crown on him and gave him the Tes mony they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said Long live the king Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people she came to the people in the temple of the LORD
When she looked there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king
All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets
So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out Treason Treason And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds the officers of the army and said to them Take her outside under guard and slay with the sword whoever follows her
For the priest had said Do not let her be killed in the house of the LORD
So they seized her and she went by way of the horses entrance into the king s house and there she was killed
Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD the king and the people that they should be the LORD S people and also between the king and the people
And all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down
They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images and killed Ma an the priest of Baal before the altars
And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD
Then he took the captains of hundreds the bodyguards the escorts and all the people of the land and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king s house
Then he sat on the throne of the kings
So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the king s house
Jehoash was seven years old when he became king
In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash became king and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Zibiah of Beersheba
Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him
But the high places were not taken away the people s ll sacrificed and burned incense on the high places
And Jehoash said to the priests All the money of the dedicated gi s that are brought into the house of the LORD each man s census money each man s assessment money and all the money that a man purposes in his heart to bring into the house of the LORD let the priests take it themselves each from his cons tuency and let them repair the damages of the temple wherever any dilapida on is found
Now it was so by the twenty third year of King Jehoash that the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple
So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple Now therefore do not take more money from your cons tuency but deliver it for repairing the damages of the temple
And the priests agreed that they would neither receive more money from the people nor repair the damages of the temple
Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest bored a hole in its lid and set it beside the altar on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD and the priests who kept the door put there all the money brought into the house of the LORD
So it was whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest that the king s scribe and the high priest came up and put it in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD
Then they gave the money which had been appor oned into the hands of those who did the work who had the oversight of the house of the LORD and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the LORD and to masons and stonecu ers and for buying mber and hewn stone to repair the damage of the house of the LORD and for all that was paid out to repair the temple
However there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver trimmers sprinkling bowls trumpets any ar cles of gold or ar cles of silver from the money brought into the house of the LORD
But they gave that to the workmen and they repaired the house of the LORD with it
Moreover they did not require an account from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be paid to workmen for they dealt faithfully
The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD
It belonged to the priests
Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath and took it then Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem

Then he went away from Jerusalem
Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah And his servants arose and formed a conspiracy and killed Joash in the house of the Millo which goes down to Silla

And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who had made Israel sin
He did not depart from them
Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Israel and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria and into the hand of Ben Hadad the son of Hazael all their days
So Jehoahaz pleaded with the LORD and the LORD listened to him for He saw the oppression of Israel because the king of Syria oppressed them
Then the LORD gave Israel a deliverer so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before
Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam who had made Israel sin but walked in them and the wooden image also remained in Samaria
For He le of the army of Jehoahaz only fi y horsemen ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing

Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over his face and said O my father my father the chariots of Israel and their horsemen And Elisha said to him Take a bow and some arrows
So he took himself a bow and some arrows
Then he said to the king of Israel Put your hand on the bow
So he put his hand on it and Elisha put his hands on the king s hands
And he said Open the east window and he opened it
Then Elisha said Shoot and he shot
And he said The arrow of the LORD S deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek ll you have destroyed them
Then he said Take the arrows so he took them
And he said to the king of Israel Strike the ground so he struck three mes and stopped
And the man of God was angry with him and said You should have struck five or six mes then you would have struck Syria ll you had destroyed it But now you will strike Syria only three mes
Then Elisha died and they buried him
And the raiding bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year
So it was as they were burying a man that suddenly they spied a band of raiders and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood on his feet
And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz
But the LORD was gracious to them had compassion on them and regarded them because of His covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and would not yet destroy them or cast them from His presence
Now Hazael king of Syria died
Then Ben Hadad his son reigned in his place
And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from the hand of Ben Hadad the son of Hazael the ci es which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war
Three mes Joash defeated him and recaptured the ci es of Israel

And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD yet not like his father David he did everything as his father Joash had done
However the high places were not taken away and the people s ll sacrificed and burned incense on the high places
Now it happened as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king
But the children of the murderers he did not execute according to what is wri en in the Book of the Law of Moses in which the LORD commanded saying Fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor shall children be put to death for their fathers but a person shall be put to death for his own sin
He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by war and called its name Joktheel to this day
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us face one another in ba le
And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son as wife and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle
You have indeed defeated Edom and your heart has li ed you up
Glory in that and stay at home for why should you meddle with trouble so that you fall you and Judah with you But Amaziah would not heed
Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out so he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh which belongs to Judah
And Judah was defeated by Israel and every man fled to his tent
Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah at Beth Shemesh and he went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate four hundred cubits
And he took all the gold and silver all the ar cles that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king s house and hostages and returned to Samaria

He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah according to the word of the LORD God of Israel which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Ami ai the prophet who was from Gath Hepher
For the LORD saw that the afflic on of Israel was very bi er and whether bond or free there was no helper for Israel
And the LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash

Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah indeed they are wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
This was the word of the LORD which He spoke to Jehu saying Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth genera on
And so it was
Shallum the son of Jabesh became king in the thirty ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah and he reigned a full month in Samaria
For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah came to Samaria and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him and he reigned in his place

Pul king of Assyria came against the land and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his control
And Menahem exacted the money from Israel from all the very wealthy from each man fi y shekels of silver to give to the king of Assyria
So the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land
Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel So Menahem rested with his fathers
Then Pekahiah his son reigned in his place
In the fi ieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria and reigned two years

In the days of Pekah king of Israel Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon Abel Beth Maachah Janoah Kedesh Hazor Gilead and Galilee all the land of Naphtali and he carried them cap ve to Assyria
Then Hoshea the son of Elah led a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah and struck and killed him so he reigned in his place in the twen eth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah
Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did indeed they are wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign
He was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done
However the high places were not removed the people s ll sacrificed and burned incense on the high places
He built the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah
So Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father
Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place
In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God as his father David had done
But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel indeed he made his son pass through the fire according to the abomina ons of the na ons whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel
And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places on the hills and under every green tree
Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to make war and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him
At that me Rezin king of Syria captured Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah from Elath
Then the Edomites went to Elath and dwell there to this day
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria saying I am your servant and your son
Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel who rise up against me
And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king s house and sent it as a present to the king of Assyria
So the king of Assyria heeded him for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it carried its people cap ve to Kir and killed Rezin
Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria and saw an altar that was at Damascus and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pa ern according to all its workmanship
Then Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus
So Urijah the priest made it before King Ahaz came back from Damascus
And when the king came back from Damascus the king saw the altar and the king approached the altar and made offerings on it
So he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar
He also brought the bronze altar which was before the LORD from the front of the temple from between the new altar and the house of the LORD and put it on the north side of the new altar
Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest saying On the great new altar burn the morning burnt offering the evening grain offering the king s burnt sacrifice and his grain offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land their grain offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice
And the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by
Thus did Urijah the priest according to all that King Ahaz commanded
And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the carts and removed the lavers from them and he took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a pavement of stones
Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion which they had built in the temple and he removed the king s outer entrance from the house of the LORD on account of the king of Assyria
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah So Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David
Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place
In the twel h year of Ahaz king of Judah Hoshea the son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria and he reigned nine years
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD but not as the kings of Israel who were before him
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute money
And the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hoshea for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year
Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison
Now the king of Assyria went throughout all the land and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years
In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria and placed them in Halah and by the Habor the River of Gozan and in the ci es of the Medes
For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt and they had feared other gods and had walked in the statutes of the na ons whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel and of the kings of Israel which they had made
Also the children of Israel secretly did against the LORD their God things that were not right and they built for themselves high places in all their ci es from watchtower to for fied city
They set up for themselves sacred pillars and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree
There they burned incense on all the high places like the na ons whom the LORD had carried away before them and they did wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger for they served idols of which the LORD had said to them You shall not do this thing
Yet the LORD tes fied against Israel and against Judah by all of His prophets every seer saying Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments and My statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets
Nevertheless they would not hear but s ffened their necks like the necks of their fathers who did not believe in the LORD their God
And they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers and His tes monies which He had tes fied against them they followed idols became idolaters and went a er the na ons who were all around them concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do like them
So they le all the commandments of the LORD their God made for themselves a molded image and two calves made a wooden image and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal
And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire prac ced witchcra and soothsaying and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger
Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight there was none le but the tribe of Judah alone
Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made
And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of plunderers un l He had cast them from His sight
For He tore Israel from the house of David and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king
Then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD and made them commit a great sin
For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did they did not depart from them un l the LORD removed Israel out of His sight as He had said by all His servants the prophets
So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria as it is to this day
Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon Cuthah Ava Hamath and from Sepharvaim and placed them in the ci es of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its ci es
And it was so at the beginning of their dwelling there that they did not fear the LORD therefore the LORD sent lions among them which killed some of them
So they spoke to the king of Assyria saying The na ons whom you have removed and placed in the ci es of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land therefore He has sent lions among them and indeed they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land
Then the king of Assyria commanded saying Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there let him go and dwell there and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land
Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the LORD
However every na on con nued to make gods of its own and put them in the shrines on the high places which the Samaritans had made every na on in the ci es where they dwelt
The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth the men of Cuth made Nergal the men of Hamath made Ashima and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim
So they feared the LORD and from every class they appointed for themselves priests of the high places who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places
They feared the LORD yet served their own gods according to the rituals of the na ons from among whom they were carried away
To this day they con nue prac cing the former rituals they do not fear the LORD nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances or the law and commandment which the LORD had commanded the children of Jacob whom He named Israel with whom the LORD had made a covenant and charged them saying You shall not fear other gods nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them but the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm Him you shall fear Him you shall worship and to Him you shall offer sacrifice
And the statutes the ordinances the law and the commandment which He wrote for you you shall be careful to observe forever you shall not fear other gods
And the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget nor shall you fear other gods
But the LORD your God you shall fear and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies
However they did not obey but they followed their former rituals
So these na ons feared the LORD yet served their carved images also their children and their children s children have con nued doing as their fathers did even to this day
Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign
He was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father David had done
He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made for un l those days the children of Israel burned incense to it and called it Nehushtan
He trusted in the LORD God of Israel so that a er him was none like him among all the kings of Judah nor who were before him
For he held fast to the LORD he did not depart from following Him but kept His commandments which the LORD had commanded Moses
The LORD was with him he prospered wherever he went
And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him
He subdued the Philis nes as far as Gaza and its territory from watchtower to for fied city
Now it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it
And at the end of three years they took it
In the sixth year of Hezekiah that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel Samaria was taken
Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away cap ve to Assyria and put them in Halah and by the Habor the River of Gozan and in the ci es of the Medes because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded and they would neither hear nor do them
And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the for fied ci es of Judah and took them
Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish saying I have done wrong turn away from me whatever you impose on me I will pay
And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king s house
At that me Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria
Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan the Rabsaris and the Rabshakeh from Lachish with a great army against Jerusalem to King Hezekiah
And they went up and came to Jerusalem
When they had come up they went and stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool which was on the highway to the Fuller s Field
And when they had called to the king Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the household Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came out to them
Then the Rabshakeh said to them Say now to Hezekiah Thus says the great king the king of Assyria What confidence is this in which you trust You speak of having plans and power for war but they are mere words
And in whom do you trust that you rebel against me Now look You are trus ng in the staff of this broken reed Egypt on which if a man leans it will go into his hand and pierce it
So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him
But if you say to me We trust in the LORD our God is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and said to Judah and Jerusalem You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem Now therefore I urge you give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able on your part to put riders on them How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master s servants and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it The LORD said to me Go up against this land and destroy it
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh Please speak to your servants in Aramaic for we understand it and do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall
But the Rabshakeh said to them Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words and not to the men who sit on the wall who will eat and drink their own waste with you Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew and spoke saying Hear the word of the great king the king of Assyria Thus says the king Do not let Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you from his hand nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD saying The LORD will surely deliver us this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria
Do not listen to Hezekiah for thus says the king of Assyria Make peace with me by a present and come out to me and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern un l I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olive groves and honey that you may live and not die
But do not listen to Hezekiah lest he persuade you saying The LORD will deliver us
Has any of the gods of the na ons at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad Where are the gods of Sepharvaim and Hena and Ivah Indeed have they delivered Samaria from my hand Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their countries from my hand that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand But the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the king s commandment was Do not answer him
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the household Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rabshakeh
And so it was when King Hezekiah heard it that he tore his clothes covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD
Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
And they said to him Thus says Hezekiah This day is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy for the children have come to birth but there is no strength to bring them forth
It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard
Therefore li up your prayer for the remnant that is le
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah
And Isaiah said to them Thus you shall say to your master Thus says the LORD Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me
Surely I will send a spirit upon him and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land
Then the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah for he heard that he had departed from Lachish
And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia Look he has come out to make war with you
So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah saying Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah saying Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you saying Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria
Look You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by u erly destroying them and shall you be delivered Have the gods of the na ons delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Telassar Where is the king of Hamath the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim Hena and Ivah And Hezekiah received the le er from the hand of the messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD
Then Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said O LORD God of Israel the One who dwells between the cherubim You are God You alone of all the kingdoms of the earth
You have made heaven and earth
Incline Your ear O LORD and hear open Your eyes O LORD and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to reproach the living God
Truly LORD the kings of Assyria have laid waste the na ons and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire for they were not gods but the work of men s hands wood and stone
Therefore they destroyed them
Now therefore O LORD our God I pray save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD God You alone
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying Thus says the LORD God of Israel Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard
This is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him The virgin the daughter of Zion Has despised you laughed you to scorn The daughter of Jerusalem Has shaken her head behind your back Whom have you reproached and blasphemed Against whom have you raised your voice And li ed up your eyes on high Against the Holy One of Israel
By your messengers you have reproached the Lord And said By the mul tude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains To the limits of Lebanon I will cut down its tall cedars And its choice cypress trees I will enter the extremity of its borders To its frui ul forest
I have dug and drunk strange water And with the soles of my feet I have dried up All the brooks of defense
Did you not hear long ago How I made it From ancient mes that I formed it Now I have brought it to pass That you should be For crushing for fied ci es into heaps of ruins
Therefore their inhabitants had li le power They were dismayed and confounded They were as the grass of the field And the green herb As the grass on the housetops And grain blighted before it is grown
But I know your dwelling place Your going out and your coming in And your rage against Me
Because your rage against Me and your tumult Have come up to My ears Therefore I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips And I will turn you back By the way which you came
This shall be a sign to you You shall eat this year such as grows of itself And in the second year what springs from the same Also in the third year sow and reap Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them
And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward And bear fruit upward
For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant And those who escape from Mount Zion
The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this
Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria He shall not come into this city Nor shoot an arrow there Nor come before it with shield Nor build a siege mound against it
By the way that he came By the same shall he return And he shall not come into this city Says the LORD
For I will defend this city to save it For My own sake and for My servant David s sake
And it came to pass on a certain night that the angel of the LORD went out and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty five thousand and when people arose early in the morning there were the corpses all dead
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away returned home and remained at Nineveh
Now it came to pass as he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and they escaped into the land of Ararat
Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place
In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death
And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz went to him and said to him Thus says the LORD Set your house in order for you shall die and not live
Then he turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the LORD saying Remember now O LORD I pray how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart and have done what was good in Your sight
And Hezekiah wept bi erly
And it happened before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court that the word of the LORD came to him saying Return and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people Thus says the LORD the God of David your father I have heard your prayer I have seen your tears surely I will heal you
On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD
And I will add to your days fi een years
I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David
Then Isaiah said Take a lump of figs
So they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered
And Hezekiah said to Isaiah What is the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day Then Isaiah said This is the sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do the thing which He has spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go backward ten degrees And Hezekiah answered It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees no but let the shadow go backward ten degrees
So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the LORD and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz
At that me Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent le ers and a present to Hezekiah for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick
And Hezekiah was a en ve to them and showed them all the house of his treasures the silver and gold the spices and precious ointment and all his armory all that was found among his treasures
There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them
Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and said to him What did these men say and from where did they come to you So Hezekiah said They came from a far country from Babylon
And he said What have they seen in your house So Hezekiah answered They have seen all that is in my house there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah Hear the word of the LORD Behold the days are coming when all that is in your house and what your fathers have accumulated un l this day shall be carried to Babylon nothing shall be le says the LORD
And they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you whom you will beget and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon
So Hezekiah said to Isaiah The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good For he said Will there not be peace and truth at least in my days Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah all his might and how he made a pool and a tunnel and brought water into the city are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah So Hezekiah rested with his fathers
Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he reigned fi y five years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Hephzibah
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD according to the abomina ons of the na ons whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed he raised up altars for Baal and made a wooden image as Ahab king of Israel had done and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them
He also built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD had said In Jerusalem I will put My name
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
Also he made his son pass through the fire prac ced soothsaying used witchcra and consulted spiri sts and mediums
He did much evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger
He even set a carved image of Asherah that he had made in the house of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel I will put My name forever and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them
But they paid no a en on and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the na ons whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel
And the LORD spoke by His servants the prophets saying Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abomina ons he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him and has also made Judah sin with his idols therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel Behold I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it both his ears will ngle
And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish wiping it and turning it upside down
So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become vic ms of plunder to all their enemies because they have done evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt even to this day
Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood ll he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another besides his sin by which he made Judah sin in doing evil in the sight of the LORD
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh all that he did and the sin that he commi ed are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah So Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of Uzza
Then his son Amon reigned in his place
Amon was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned two years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD as his father Manasseh had done
So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked and he served the idols that his father had served and worshiped them
He forsook the LORD God of his fathers and did not walk in the way of the LORD
Then the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house
But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon
Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza
Then Josiah his son reigned in his place
Josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned thirty one years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD and walked in all the ways of his father David he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the le
Now it came to pass in the eighteenth year of King Josiah that the king sent Shaphan the scribe the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam to the house of the LORD saying Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of the LORD which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people
And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work who are the overseers in the house of the LORD let them give it to those who are in the house of the LORD doing the work to repair the damages of the house to carpenters and builders and masons and to buy mber and hewn stone to repair the house
However there need be no accoun ng made with them of the money delivered into their hand because they deal faithfully
Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD
And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan and he read it
So Shaphan the scribe went to the king bringing the king word saying Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work who oversee the house of the LORD
Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king saying Hilkiah the priest has given me a book
And Shaphan read it before the king
Now it happened when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law that he tore his clothes
Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest Ahikam the son of Shaphan Achbor the son of Michaiah Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah a servant of the king saying Go inquire of the LORD for me for the people and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found for great is the wrath of the LORD that is aroused against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book to do according to all that is wri en concerning us
So Hilkiah the priest Ahikam Achbor Shaphan and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Harhas keeper of the wardrobe
She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter
And they spoke with her
Then she said to them Thus says the LORD God of Israel Tell the man who sent you to Me Thus says the LORD Behold I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands
Therefore My wrath shall be aroused against this place and shall not be quenched
But as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD in this manner you shall speak to him Thus says the LORD God of Israel Concerning the words which you have heard because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants that they would become a desola on and a curse and you tore your clothes and wept before Me I also have heard you says the LORD
Surely therefore I will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place
So they brought back word to the king
Now the king sent them to gather all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to him
The king went up to the house of the LORD with all the men of Judah and with him all the inhabitants of Jerusalem the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great
And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD
Then the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments and His tes monies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul to perform the words of this covenant that were wri en in this book
And all the people took a stand for the covenant
And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest the priests of the second order and the doorkeepers to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the ar cles that were made for Baal for Asherah and for all the host of heaven and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel
Then he removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the ci es of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem and those who burned incense to Baal to the sun to the moon to the constella ons and to all the host of heaven
And he brought out the wooden image from the house of the LORD to the Brook Kidron outside Jerusalem burned it at the Brook Kidron and ground it to ashes and threw its ashes on the graves of the common people
Then he tore down the ritual booths of the perverted persons that were in the house of the LORD where the women wove hangings for the wooden image
And he brought all the priests from the ci es of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from Geba to Beersheba also he broke down the high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city which were to the le of the city gate
Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren
And he defiled Topheth which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech
Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the entrance to the house of the LORD by the chamber of Nathan Melech the officer who was in the court and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire
The altars that were on the roof the upper chamber of Ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD the king broke down and pulverized there and threw their dust into the Brook Kidron
Then the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem which were on the south of the Mount of Corrup on which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomina on of the Sidonians for Chemosh the abomina on of the Moabites and for Milcom the abomina on of the people of Ammon
And he broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images and filled their places with the bones of men
Moreover the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel sin had made both that altar and the high place he broke down and he burned the high place and crushed it to powder and burned the wooden image
As Josiah turned he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain
And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed who proclaimed these words
Then he said What gravestone is this that I see So the men of the city told him It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel
And he said Let him alone let no one move his bones
So they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria
Now Josiah also took away all the shrines of the high places that were in the ci es of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger and he did to them according to all the deeds he had done in Bethel
He executed all the priests of the high places who were there on the altars and burned men s bones on them and he returned to Jerusalem
Then the king commanded all the people saying Keep the Passover to the LORD your God as it is wri en in this Book of the Covenant
Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah
But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was held before the LORD in Jerusalem
Moreover Josiah put away those who consulted mediums and spiri sts the household gods and idols all the abomina ons that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem that he might perform the words of the law which were wri en in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD
Now before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart with all his soul and with all his might according to all the Law of Moses nor a er him did any arise like him
Nevertheless the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath with which His anger was aroused against Judah because of all the provoca ons with which Manasseh had provoked Him
And the LORD said I will also remove Judah from My sight as I have removed Israel and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen and the house of which I said My name shall be there
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went to the aid of the king of Assyria to the River Euphrates and King Josiah went against him
And Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo when he confronted him
Then his servants moved his body in a chariot from Megiddo brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah anointed him and made him king in his father s place
Jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king and he reigned three months in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that his fathers had done
Now Pharaoh Necho put him in prison at Riblah in the land of Hamath that he might not reign in Jerusalem and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
Then Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim
And Pharaoh took Jehoahaz and went to Egypt and he died there
So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh but he taxed the land to give money according to the command of Pharaoh he exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land from every one according to his assessment to give it to Pharaoh Necho
Jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that his fathers had done
In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years
Then he turned and rebelled against him
And the LORD sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans bands of Syrians bands of Moabites and bands of the people of Ammon He sent them against Judah to destroy it according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken by His servants the prophets
Surely at the commandment of the LORD this came upon Judah to remove them from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh according to all that he had done and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood which the LORD would not pardon
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers
Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place
And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem three months
His mother s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father had done
At that me the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem and the city was besieged
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city as his servants were besieging it
Then Jehoiachin king of Judah his mother his servants his princes and his officers went out to the king of Babylon and the king of Babylon in the eighth year of his reign took him prisoner
And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king s house and he cut in pieces all the ar cles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD as the LORD had said
Also he carried into cap vity all Jerusalem all the captains and all the mighty men of valor ten thousand cap ves and all the cra smen and smiths
None remained except the poorest people of the land
And he carried Jehoiachin cap ve to Babylon
The king s mother the king s wives his officers and the mighty of the land he carried into cap vity from Jerusalem to Babylon
All the valiant men seven thousand and cra smen and smiths one thousand all who were strong and fit for war these the king of Babylon brought cap ve to Babylon
Then the king of Babylon made Ma aniah Jehoiachin s uncle king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah
Zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah
He also did evil in the sight of the LORD according to all that Jehoiakim had done
For because of the anger of the LORD this happened in Jerusalem and Judah that He finally cast them out from His presence
Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon
Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it and they built a siege wall against it all around
So the city was besieged un l the eleventh year of King Zedekiah
By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land
Then the city wall was broken through and all the men of war fled at night by way of the gate between two walls which was by the king s garden even though the Chaldeans were s ll encamped all around against the city
And the king went by way of the plain
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho
All his army was sca ered from him
So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah and they pronounced judgment on him
Then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes put out the eyes of Zedekiah bound him with bronze fe ers and took him to Babylon
And in the fi h month on the seventh day of the month which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard a servant of the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
He burned the house of the LORD and the king s house all the houses of Jerusalem that is all the houses of the great he burned with fire
And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away cap ve the rest of the people who remained in the city and the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon with the rest of the mul tude
But the captain of the guard le some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers
The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the LORD the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried their bronze to Babylon
They also took away the pots the shovels the trimmers the spoons and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered
The firepans and the basins the things of solid gold and solid silver the captain of the guard took away
The two pillars one Sea and the carts which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD the bronze of all these ar cles was beyond measure
The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits and the capital on it was of bronze
The height of the capital was three cubits and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze
The second pillar was the same with a network
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest Zephaniah the second priest and the three doorkeepers
He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war five men of the king s close associates who were found in the city the chief recrui ng officer of the army who mustered the people of the land and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city
So Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah
Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath
Thus Judah was carried away cap ve from its own land
Then he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had le
Now when all the captains of the armies they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah Ishmael the son of Nethaniah Johanan the son of Careah Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite they and their men
And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men and said to them Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans
Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with you
But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the royal family came with ten men and struck and killed Gedaliah the Jews as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah
And all the people small and great and the captains of the armies arose and went to Egypt for they were afraid of the Chaldeans
Now it came to pass in the thirty seventh year of the cap vity of Jehoiachin king of Judah in the twel h month on the twenty seventh day of the month that Evil Merodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison
He spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon
So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life
And as for his provisions there was a regular ra on given him by the king a por on for each day all the days of his life

A er him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite who was one of the three mighty men
He was with David at Pasdammim
Now there the Philis nes were gathered for ba le and there was a piece of ground full of barley
And the people fled from the Philis nes
But they sta oned themselves in the middle of that field defended it and killed the Philis nes
So the LORD brought about a great victory
Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David into the cave of Adullam and the army of the Philis nes encamped in the Valley of Rephaim
David was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the Philis nes was then in Bethlehem
And David said with longing Oh that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate So the three broke through the camp of the Philis nes drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David
Nevertheless David would not drink it but poured it out to the LORD
And he said Far be it from me O my God that I should do this Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy For at the risk of their lives they brought it
Therefore he would not drink it
These things were done by the three mighty men
Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three
He had li ed up his spear against three hundred men killed them and won a name among these three
Of the three he was more honored than the other two men
Therefore he became their captain
However he did not a ain to the first three
Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel who had done many deeds
He had killed two lion like heroes of Moab
He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day
And he killed an Egyp an a man of great height five cubits tall
In the Egyp an s hand there was a spear like a weaver s beam and he went down to him with a staff wrested the spear out of the Egyp an s hand and killed him with his own spear
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did and won a name among three mighty men
Indeed he was more honored than the thirty but he did not a ain to the first three
And David appointed him over his guard
Also the mighty warriors were Asahel the brother of Joab Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem Shammoth the Harorite Helez the Pelonite Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite Abiezer the Anathothite Sibbechai the Hushathite Ilai the Ahohite Maharai the Netophathite Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin Benaiah the Pirathonite Hurai of the brooks of Gaash Abiel the Arbathite Azmaveth the Baharumite Eliahba the Shaalbonite the sons of Hashem the Gizonite Jonathan the son of Shageh the Hararite Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite Eliphal the son of Ur Hepher the Mecherathite Ahijah the Pelonite Hezro the Carmelite Naarai the son of Ezbai Joel the brother of Nathan Mibhar the son of Hagri Zelek the Ammonite Naharai the Berothite the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah Ira the Ithrite Gareb the Ithrite Uriah the Hi te Zabad the son of Ahlai Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite a chief of the Reubenites and thirty with him Hanan the son of Maachah Joshaphat the Mithnite Uzzia the Ashterathite Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite Jediael the son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite Eliel the Mahavite Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam Ithmah the Moabite Eliel Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite
Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was s ll a fugi ve from Saul the son of Kish and they were among the mighty men helpers in the war armed with bows using both the right hand and the le in hurling stones and shoo ng arrows with the bow
They were of Benjamin Saul s brethren
The chief was Ahiezer then Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth Berachah and Jehu the Anathothite Ishmaiah the Gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty and over the thirty Jeremiah Jahaziel Johanan and Jozabad the Gederathite Eluzai Jerimoth Bealiah Shemariah and Shepha ah the Haruphite Elkanah Jisshiah Azarel Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor
Some Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness mighty men of valor men trained for ba le who could handle shield and spear whose faces were like the faces of lions and were as swi as gazelles on the mountains Ezer the first Obadiah the second Eliab the third Mishmannah the fourth Jeremiah the fi h A ai the sixth Eliel the seventh Johanan the eighth Elzabad the ninth Jeremiah the tenth and Machbanai the eleventh
These were from the sons of Gad captains of the army the least was over a hundred and the greatest was over a thousand
These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it had overflowed all its banks and they put to flight all those in the valleys to the east and to the west
Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold
And David went out to meet them and answered and said to them If you have come peaceably to me to help me my heart will be united with you but if to betray me to my enemies since there is no wrong in my hands may the God of our fathers look and bring judgment
Then the Spirit came upon Amasai chief of the captains and he said We are yours O David We are on your side O son of Jesse Peace peace to you And peace to your helpers For your God helps you
So David received them and made them captains of the troop
And some from Manasseh defected to David when he was going with the Philis nes to ba le against Saul but they did not help them for the lords of the Philis nes sent him away by agreement saying He may defect to his master Saul and endanger our heads
When he went to Ziklag those of Manasseh who defected to him were Adnah Jozabad Jediael Michael Jozabad Elihu and Zillethai captains of the thousands who were from Manasseh
And they helped David against the bands of raiders for they were all mighty men of valor and they were captains in the army
For at that me they came to David day by day to help him un l it was a great army like the army of God
Now these were the numbers of the divisions that were equipped for war and came to David at Hebron to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the LORD of the sons of Judah bearing shield and spear six thousand eight hundred armed for war of the sons of Simeon mighty men of valor fit for war seven thousand one hundred of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred Jehoiada the leader of the Aaronites and with him three thousand seven hundred Zadok a young man a valiant warrior and from his father s house twenty two captains of the sons of Benjamin rela ves of Saul three thousand un l then the greatest part of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred mighty men of valor famous men throughout their father s house of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand who were designated by name to come and make David king of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the mes to know what Israel ought to do their chiefs were two hundred and all their brethren were at their command of Zebulun there were fi y thousand who went out to ba le expert in war with all weapons of war stouthearted men who could keep ranks of Naphtali one thousand captains and with them thirty seven thousand with shield and spear of the Danites who could keep ba le forma on twenty eight thousand six hundred of Asher those who could go out to war able to keep ba le forma on forty thousand of the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh from the other side of the Jordan one hundred and twenty thousand armed for ba le with every kind of weapon of war
All these men of war who could keep ranks came to Hebron with a loyal heart to make David king over all Israel and all the rest of Israel were of one mind to make David king
And they were there with David three days ea ng and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them
Moreover those who were near to them from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali were bringing food on donkeys and camels on mules and oxen provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there was joy in Israel
Then David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader
And David said to all the assembly of Israel If it seems good to you and if it is of the LORD our God let us send out to our brethren everywhere who are le in all the land of Israel and with them to the priests and Levites who are in their ci es and their common lands that they may gather together to us and let us bring the ark of our God back to us for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul
Then all the assembly said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people
So David gathered all Israel together from Shihor in Egypt to as far as the entrance of Hamath to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim
And David and all Israel went up to Baalah to Kirjath Jearim which belonged to Judah to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD who dwells between the cherubim where His name is proclaimed
So they carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart
Then David and all Israel played music before God with all their might with singing on harps on stringed instruments on tambourines on cymbals and with trumpets
And when they came to Chidon s threshing floor Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled
Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzza and He struck him because he put his hand to the ark and he died there before God
And David became angry because of the LORD S outbreak against Uzza therefore that place is called Perez Uzza to this day
David was afraid of God that day saying How can I bring the ark of God to me So David would not move the ark with him into the City of David but took it aside into the house of Obed Edom the Gi te
The ark of God remained with the family of Obed Edom in his house three months
And the LORD blessed the house of Obed Edom and all that he had
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David and cedar trees with masons and carpenters to build him a house
So David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel for his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel
Then David took more wives in Jerusalem and David begot more sons and daughters
And these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem Shammua Shobab Nathan Solomon Ibhar Elishua Elpelet Nogah Nepheg Japhia Elishama Beeliada and Eliphelet
Now when the Philis nes heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel all the Philis nes went up to search for David
And David heard of it and went out against them
Then the Philis nes went and made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim
And David inquired of God saying Shall I go up against the Philis nes Will You deliver them into my hand And the LORD said to him Go up for I will deliver them into your hand
So they went up to Baal Perazim and David defeated them there
Then David said God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water
Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim
And when they le their gods there David gave a commandment and they were burned with fire
Then the Philis nes once again made a raid on the valley
Therefore David inquired again of God and God said to him You shall not go up a er them circle around them and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees
And it shall be when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees then you shall go out to ba le for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philis nes
So David did as God commanded him and they drove back the army of the Philis nes from Gibeon as far as Gezer
Then the fame of David went out into all lands and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all na ons
David built houses for himself in the City of David and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it
Then David said No one may carry the ark of God but the Levites for the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to minister before Him forever
And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place which he had prepared for it
Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites of the sons of Kohath Uriel the chief and one hundred and twenty of his brethren of the sons of Merari Asaiah the chief and two hundred and twenty of his brethren of the sons of Gershom Joel the chief and one hundred and thirty of his brethren of the sons of Elizaphan Shemaiah the chief and two hundred of his brethren of the sons of Hebron Eliel the chief and eighty of his brethren of the sons of Uzziel Amminadab the chief and one hundred and twelve of his brethren
And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests and for the Levites for Uriel Asaiah Joel Shemaiah Eliel and Amminadab
He said to them You are the heads of the fathers houses of the Levites sanc fy yourselves you and your brethren that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it
For because you did not do it the first me the LORD our God broke out against us because we did not consult Him about the proper order
So the priests and the Levites sanc fied themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel
And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders by its poles as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD
Then David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers accompanied by instruments of music stringed instruments harps and cymbals by raising the voice with resounding joy
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel and of his brethren Asaph the son of Berechiah and of their brethren the sons of Merari Ethan the son of Kushaiah and with them their brethren of the second rank Zechariah Ben Jaaziel Shemiramoth Jehiel Unni Eliab Benaiah Maaseiah Ma thiah Elipheleh Mikneiah Obed Edom and Jeiel the gatekeepers the singers Heman Asaph and Ethan were to sound the cymbals of bronze Zechariah Aziel Shemiramoth Jehiel Unni Eliab Maaseiah and Benaiah with strings according to Alamoth Ma thiah Elipheleh Mikneiah Obed Edom Jeiel and Azaziah to direct with harps on the Sheminith Chenaniah leader of the Levites was instructor in charge of the music because he was skillful Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark Shebaniah Joshaphat Nethanel Amasai Zechariah Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God and Obed Edom and Jehiah doorkeepers for the ark
So David the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed Edom with joy
And so it was when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD that they offered seven bulls and seven rams
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen as were all the Levites who bore the ark the singers and Chenaniah the music master with the singers
David also wore a linen ephod
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shou ng and with the sound of the horn with trumpets and with cymbals making music with stringed instruments and harps
And it happened as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the City of David that Michal Saul s daughter looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing music and she despised him in her heart
So they brought the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it
Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God
And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the LORD
Then he distributed to everyone of Israel both man and woman to everyone a loaf of bread a piece of meat and a cake of raisins
And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD to commemorate to thank and to praise the LORD God of Israel Asaph the chief and next to him Zechariah then Jeiel Shemiramoth Jehiel Ma thiah Eliab Benaiah and Obed Edom Jeiel with stringed instruments and harps but Asaph made music with cymbals Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests regularly blew the trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God
On that day David first delivered this psalm into the hand of Asaph and his brethren to thank the LORD Oh give thanks to the LORD Call upon His name Make known His deeds among the peoples Sing to Him sing psalms to Him Talk of all His wondrous works Glory in His holy name Let the hearts of those rejoice who seek the LORD Seek the LORD and His strength Seek His face evermore Remember His marvelous works which He has done His wonders and the judgments of His mouth O seed of Israel His servant You children of Jacob His chosen ones He is the LORD our God His judgments are in all the earth
Remember His covenant forever The word which He commanded for a thousand genera ons The covenant which He made with Abraham And His oath to Isaac And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute To Israel for an everlas ng covenant Saying To you I will give the land of Canaan As the allotment of your inheritance When you were few in number Indeed very few and strangers in it
When they went from one na on to another And from one kingdom to another people He permi ed no man to do them wrong Yes He rebuked kings for their sakes Saying Do not touch My anointed ones And do My prophets no harm
Sing to the LORD all the earth Proclaim the good news of His salva on from day to day
Declare His glory among the na ons His wonders among all peoples
For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised He is also to be feared above all gods
For all the gods of the peoples are idols But the LORD made the heavens
Honor and majesty are before Him Strength and gladness are in His place
Give to the LORD O families of the peoples Give to the LORD glory and strength
Give to the LORD the glory due His name Bring an offering and come before Him
Oh worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness Tremble before Him all the earth
The world also is firmly established It shall not be moved
Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad And let them say among the na ons The LORD reigns
Let the sea roar and all its fullness Let the field rejoice and all that is in it
Then the trees of the woods shall rejoice before the LORD For He is coming to judge the earth
Oh give thanks to the LORD for He is good For His mercy endures forever
And say Save us O God of our salva on Gather us together and deliver us from the Gen les To give thanks to Your holy name To triumph in Your praise
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel From everlas ng to everlas ng And all the people said Amen and praised the LORD
So he le Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister before the ark regularly as every day s work required and Obed Edom with his sixty eight brethren including Obed Edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be gatekeepers and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place that was at Gibeon to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening and to do according to all that is wri en in the Law of the LORD which He commanded Israel and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen who were designated by name to give thanks to the LORD because His mercy endures forever and with them Heman and Jeduthun to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and the musical instruments of God
Now the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers
Then all the people departed every man to his house and David returned to bless his house
Now it came to pass when David was dwelling in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet See now I dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under tent curtains
Then Nathan said to David Do all that is in your heart for God is with you
But it happened that night that the word of God came to Nathan saying Go and tell My servant David Thus says the LORD You shall not build Me a house to dwell in
For I have not dwelt in a house since the me that I brought up Israel even to this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another
Wherever I have moved about with all Israel have I ever spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd My people saying Why have you not built Me a house of cedar Now therefore thus shall you say to My servant David Thus says the LORD of hosts I took you from the sheepfold from following the sheep to be ruler over My people Israel
And I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you and have made you a name like the name of the great men who are on the earth
Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore as previously since the me that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel
Also I will subdue all your enemies
Furthermore I tell you that the LORD will build you a house
And it shall be when your days are fulfilled when you must go to be with your fathers that I will set up your seed a er you who will be of your sons and I will establish his kingdom
He shall build Me a house and I will establish his throne forever
I will be his Father and he shall be My son and I will not take My mercy away from him as I took it from him who was before you
And I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever and his throne shall be established forever
According to all these words and according to all this vision so Nathan spoke to David
Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and he said Who am I O LORD God And what is my house that You have brought me this far And yet this was a small thing in Your sight O God and You have also spoken of Your servant s house for a great while to come and have regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree O LORD God
What more can David say to You for the honor of Your servant For You know Your servant
O LORD for Your servant s sake and according to Your own heart You have done all this greatness in making known all these great things
O LORD there is none like You nor is there any God besides You according to all that we have heard with our ears
And who is like Your people Israel the one na on on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people to make for Yourself a name by great and awesome deeds by driving out na ons from before Your people whom You redeemed from Egypt For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever and You LORD have become their God
And now O LORD the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house let it be established forever and do as You have said
So let it be established that Your name may be magnified forever saying The LORD of hosts the God of Israel is Israel s God
And let the house of Your servant David be established before You
For You O my God have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house
Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray before You
And now LORD You are God and have promised this goodness to Your servant
Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant that it may con nue before You forever for You have blessed it O LORD and it shall be blessed forever
A er this it came to pass that David a acked the Philis nes subdued them and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philis nes
Then he defeated Moab and the Moabites became David s servants and brought tribute
And David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath as he went to establish his power by the River Euphrates
David took from him one thousand chariots seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers
And David also hamstrung all the chariot horses except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots
When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah David killed twenty two thousand of the Syrians
Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus and the Syrians became David s servants and brought tribute
So the LORD preserved David wherever he went
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem
Also from Tibhath and from Chun ci es of Hadadezer David brought a large amount of bronze with which Solomon made the bronze Sea the pillars and the ar cles of bronze
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou and Hadoram brought with him all kinds of ar cles of gold silver and bronze
King David also dedicated these to the LORD along with the silver and gold that he had brought from all these na ons from Edom from Moab from the people of Ammon from the Philis nes and from Amalek
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt
He also put garrisons in Edom and all the Edomites became David s servants
And the LORD preserved David wherever he went
So David reigned over all Israel and administered judgment and jus ce to all his people
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests Shavsha was the scribe Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites and David s sons were chief ministers at the king s side
It happened a er this that Nahash the king of the people of Ammon died and his son reigned in his place
Then David said I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash because his father showed kindness to me
So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father
And David s servants came to Hanun in the land of the people of Ammon to comfort him
And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you Did his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land Therefore Hanun took David s servants shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle at their bu ocks and sent them away
Then some went and told David about the men and he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed
And the king said Wait at Jericho un l your beards have grown and then return
When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David Hanun and the people of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia from Syrian Maachah and from Zobah
So they hired for themselves thirty two thousand chariots with the king of Maachah and his people who came and encamped before Medeba
Also the people of Ammon gathered together from their ci es and came to ba le
Now when David heard of it he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men
Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in ba le array before the gate of the city and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field
When Joab saw that the ba le line was against him before and behind he chose some of Israel s best and put them in ba le array against the Syrians
And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother and they set themselves in ba le array against the people of Ammon
Then he said If the Syrians are too strong for me then you shall help me but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you then I will help you
Be of good courage and let us be strong for our people and for the ci es of our God
And may the LORD do what is good in His sight
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the ba le against the Syrians and they fled before him
When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing they also fled before Abishai his brother and entered the city
So Joab went to Jerusalem
Now when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel they sent messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond the River and Shophach the commander of Hadadezer s army went before them
When it was told David he gathered all Israel crossed over the Jordan and came upon them and set up in ba le array against them
So when David had set up in ba le array against the Syrians they fought with him
Then the Syrians fled before Israel and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians and killed Shophach the commander of the army
And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel they made peace with David and became his servants
So the Syrians were not willing to help the people of Ammon anymore
It happened in the spring of the year at the me kings go out to ba le that Joab led out the armed forces and ravaged the country of the people of Ammon and came and besieged Rabbah
But David stayed at Jerusalem
And Joab defeated Rabbah and overthrew it
Then David took their king s crown from his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it
And it was set on David s head
Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance
And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws with iron picks and with axes
So David did to all the ci es of the people of Ammon
Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem
Now it happened a erward that war broke out at Gezer with the Philis nes at which me Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai who was one of the sons of the giant
And they were subdued
Again there was war with the Philis nes and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gi te the sha of whose spear was like a weaver s beam
Yet again there was war at Gath where there was a man of great stature with twenty four fingers and toes six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was born to the giant
So when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Shimea David s brother killed him
These were born to the giant in Gath and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants
Now Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel
So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people Go number Israel from Beersheba to Dan and bring the number of them to me that I may know it
And Joab answered May the LORD make His people a hundred mes more than they are
But my lord the king are they not all my lord s servants Why then does my lord require this thing Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel Nevertheless the king s word prevailed against Joab
Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem
Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David
All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword
But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them for the king s word was abominable to Joab
And God was displeased with this thing therefore He struck Israel
So David said to God I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing but now I pray take away the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly
And the LORD spoke to Gad David s seer saying Go and tell David saying Thus says the LORD I offer you three things choose one of them for yourself that I may do it to you
So Gad came to David and said to him Thus says the LORD Choose for yourself either three years of famine or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you or else for three days the sword of the LORD the plague in the land with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel
Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me
And David said to Gad I am in great distress
Please let me fall into the hand of the LORD for His mercies are very great but do not let me fall into the hand of man
So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel and seventy thousand men of Israel fell
And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it
As he was destroying the LORD looked and relented of the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying It is enough now restrain your hand
And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite
Then David li ed his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem
So David and the elders clothed in sackcloth fell on their faces
And David said to God Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed but these sheep what have they done Let Your hand I pray O LORD my God be against me and my father s house but not against Your people that they should be plagued
Therefore the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite
So David went up at the word of Gad which he had spoken in the name of the LORD
Now Ornan turned and saw the angel and his four sons who were with him hid themselves but Ornan con nued threshing wheat
Then David came to Ornan and Ornan looked and saw David
And he went out from the threshing floor and bowed before David with his face to the ground
Then David said to Ornan Grant me the place of this threshing floor that I may build an altar on it to the LORD
You shall grant it to me at the full price that the plague may be withdrawn from the people
And Ornan said to David Take it to yourself and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes
Look I also give you the oxen for burnt offerings the threshing implements for wood and the wheat for the grain offering I give it all
Then King David said to Ornan No but I will surely buy it for the full price for I will not take what is yours for the LORD nor offer burnt offerings with that which costs me nothing
So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place
And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the LORD and He answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering
So the LORD commanded the angel and he returned his sword to its sheath
At that me when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite he sacrificed there
For the tabernacle of the LORD and the altar of the burnt offering which Moses had made in the wilderness were at that me at the high place in Gibeon
But David could not go before it to inquire of God for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD
Then David said This is the house of the LORD God and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel
So David commanded to gather the aliens who were in the land of Israel and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints and bronze in abundance beyond measure and cedar trees in abundance for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought much cedar wood to David
Now David said Solomon my son is young and inexperienced and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent famous and glorious throughout all countries
I will now make prepara on for it
So David made abundant prepara ons before his death
Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel
And David said to Solomon My son as for me it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God but the word of the LORD came to me saying You have shed much blood and have made great wars you shall not build a house for My name because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight
Behold a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around
His name shall be Solomon for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days
He shall build a house for My name and he shall be My son and I will be his Father and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever
Now my son may the LORD be with you and may you prosper and build the house of the LORD your God as He has said to you
Only may the LORD give you wisdom and understanding and give you charge concerning Israel that you may keep the law of the LORD your God
Then you will prosper if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments with which the LORD charged Moses concerning Israel
Be strong and of good courage do not fear nor be dismayed
Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver and bronze and iron beyond measure for it is so abundant
I have prepared mber and stone also and you may add to them
Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance woodsmen and stonecu ers and all types of skillful men for every kind of work
Of gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no limit
Arise and begin working and the LORD be with you
David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son saying Is not the LORD your God with you And has He not given you rest on every side For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand and the land is subdued before the LORD and before His people
Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God
Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy ar cles of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD
So when David was old and full of days he made his son Solomon king over Israel
And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and the Levites
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and above and the number of individual males was thirty eight thousand
Of these twenty four thousand were to look a er the work of the house of the LORD six thousand were officers and judges four thousand were gatekeepers and four thousand praised the LORD with musical instruments which I made said David for giving praise
Also David separated them into divisions among the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari
Of the Gershonites Laadan and Shimei
The sons of Laadan the first Jehiel then Zetham and Joel three in all
The sons of Shimei Shelomith Haziel and Haran three in all
These were the heads of the fathers houses of Laadan
And the sons of Shimei Jahath Zina Jeush and Beriah
These were the four sons of Shimei
Jahath was the first and Zizah the second
But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons therefore they were assigned as one father s house
The sons of Kohath Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel four in all
The sons of Amram Aaron and Moses and Aaron was set apart he and his sons forever that he should sanc fy the most holy things to burn incense before the LORD to minister to Him and to give the blessing in His name forever
Now the sons of Moses the man of God were reckoned to the tribe of Levi
The sons of Moses were Gershon and Eliezer
Of the sons of Gershon Shebuel was the first
Of the descendants of Eliezer Rehabiah was the first
And Eliezer had no other sons but the sons of Rehabiah were very many

The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish
And Eleazar died and had no sons but only daughters and their brethren the sons of Kish took them as wives
The sons of Mushi were Mahli Eder and Jeremoth three in all
These were the sons of Levi by their fathers houses the heads of the fathers houses as they were counted individually by the number of their names who did the work for the service of the house of the LORD from the age of twenty years and above
For David said The LORD God of Israel has given rest to His people that they may dwell in Jerusalem forever and also to the Levites They shall no longer carry the tabernacle or any of the ar cles for its service
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above because their duty was to help the sons of Aaron in the service of the house of the LORD in the courts and in the chambers in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of God both with the showbread and the fine flour for the grain offering with the unleavened cakes and what is baked in the pan with what is mixed and with all kinds of measures and sizes to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD and likewise at evening and at every presenta on of a burnt offering to the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the New Moons and on the set feasts by number according to the ordinance governing them regularly before the LORD and that they should a end to the needs of the tabernacle of mee ng the needs of the holy place and the needs of the sons of Aaron their brethren in the work of the house of the LORD
Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron
The sons of Aaron were Nadab Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar
And Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children therefore Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests
Then David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar divided them according to the schedule of their service
There were more leaders found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar and thus they were divided
Among the sons of Eleazar were sixteen heads of their fathers houses and eight heads of their fathers houses among the sons of Ithamar
Thus they were divided by lot one group as another for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of the house of God from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar
And the scribe Shemaiah the son of Nethanel one of the Levites wrote them down before the king the leaders Zadok the priest Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of the fathers houses of the priests and Levites one father s house taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar

These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers houses
These also cast lots just as their brothers the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David Zadok Ahimelech and the heads of the fathers houses of the priests and Levites
The chief fathers did just as their younger brethren
Moreover David and the captains of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph of Heman and of Jeduthun who should prophesy with harps stringed instruments and cymbals
And the number of the skilled men performing their service was Of the sons of Asaph Zaccur Joseph Nethaniah and Asharelah the sons of Asaph were under the direc on of Asaph who prophesied according to the order of the king

For God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters
All these were under the direc on of their father for the music in the house of the LORD with cymbals stringed instruments and harps for the service of the house of God
Asaph Jeduthun and Heman were under the authority of the king
So the number of them with their brethren who were instructed in the songs of the LORD all who were skillful was two hundred and eighty eight
And they cast lots for their duty the small as well as the great the teacher with the student
Now the first lot for Asaph came out for Joseph the second for Gedaliah him with his brethren and sons twelve the third for Zaccur his sons and his brethren twelve the fourth for Jizri his sons and his brethren twelve the fi h for Nethaniah his sons and his brethren twelve the sixth for Bukkiah his sons and his brethren twelve the seventh for Jesharelah his sons and his brethren twelve the eighth for Jeshaiah his sons and his brethren twelve the ninth for Ma aniah his sons and his brethren twelve the tenth for Shimei his sons and his brethren twelve the eleventh for Azarel his sons and his brethren twelve the twel h for Hashabiah his sons and his brethren twelve the thirteenth for Shubael his sons and his brethren twelve the fourteenth for Ma thiah his sons and his brethren twelve the fi eenth for Jeremoth his sons and his brethren twelve the sixteenth for Hananiah his sons and his brethren twelve the seventeenth for Joshbekashah his sons and his brethren twelve the eighteenth for Hanani his sons and his brethren twelve the nineteenth for Mallothi his sons and his brethren twelve the twen eth for Eliathah his sons and his brethren twelve the twenty first for Hothir his sons and his brethren twelve the twenty second for Giddal his sons and his brethren twelve the twenty third for Mahazioth his sons and his brethren twelve the twenty fourth for Romam Ezer his sons and his brethren twelve

And all that Samuel the seer Saul the son of Kish Abner the son of Ner and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated every dedicated thing was under the hand of Shelomith and his brethren

These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel
But David did not take the number of those twenty years old and under because the LORD had said He would mul ply Israel like the stars of the heavens
Joab the son of Zeruiah began a census but he did not finish for wrath came upon Israel because of this census nor was the number recorded in the account of the chronicles of King David

Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the leaders of Israel the officers of the tribes and the captains of the divisions who served the king the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and the stewards over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons with the officials the valiant men and all the mighty men of valor
Then King David rose to his feet and said Hear me my brethren and my people I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the footstool of our God and had made prepara ons to build it
But God said to me You shall not build a house for My name because you have been a man of war and have shed blood
However the LORD God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever for He has chosen Judah to be the ruler and of the house of Judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father He was pleased with me to make me king over all Israel
And of all my sons for the LORD has given me many sons He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel
Now He said to me It is your son Solomon who shall build My house and My courts for I have chosen him to be My son and I will be his Father
Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever if he is steadfast to observe My commandments and My judgments as it is this day
Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the assembly of the LORD and in the hearing of our God be careful to seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your children a er you forever
As for you my son Solomon know the God of your father and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind for the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts
If you seek Him He will be found by you but if you forsake Him He will cast you off forever
Consider now for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary be strong and do it
Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the ves bule its houses its treasuries its upper chambers its inner chambers and the place of the mercy seat and the plans for all that he had by the Spirit of the courts of the house of the LORD of all the chambers all around of the treasuries of the house of God and of the treasuries for the dedicated things also for the division of the priests and the Levites for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD and for all the ar cles of service in the house of the LORD
He gave gold by weight for things of gold for all ar cles used in every kind of service also silver for all ar cles of silver by weight for all ar cles used in every kind of service the weight for the lampstands of gold and their lamps of gold by weight for each lampstand and its lamps for the lampstands of silver by weight for the lampstand and its lamps according to the use of each lampstand
And by weight he gave gold for the tables of the showbread for each table and silver for the tables of silver also pure gold for the forks the basins the pitchers of pure gold and the golden bowls he gave gold by weight for every bowl and for the silver bowls silver by weight for every bowl and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense and for the construc on of the chariot that is the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the LORD
All this said David the LORD made me understand in wri ng by His hand upon me all the works of these plans
And David said to his son Solomon Be strong and of good courage and do it do not fear nor be dismayed for the LORD God my God will be with you
He will not leave you nor forsake you un l you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD
Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God and every willing cra sman will be with you for all manner of workmanship for every kind of service also the leaders and all the people will be completely at your command
Furthermore King David said to all the assembly My son Solomon whom alone God has chosen is young and inexperienced and the work is great because the temple is not for man but for the LORD God
Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might gold for things to be made of gold silver for things of silver bronze for things of bronze iron for things of iron wood for things of wood onyx stones stones to be set glistening stones of various colors all kinds of precious stones and marble slabs in abundance
Moreover because I have set my affec on on the house of my God I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house my own special treasure of gold and silver three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of cra smen
Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the LORD Then the leaders of the fathers houses leaders of the tribes of Israel the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the officers over the king s work offered willingly
They gave for the work of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold ten thousand talents of silver eighteen thousand talents of bronze and one hundred thousand talents of iron
And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite
Then the people rejoiced for they had offered willingly because with a loyal heart they had offered willingly to the LORD and King David also rejoiced greatly
Therefore David blessed the LORD before all the assembly and David said Blessed are You LORD God of Israel our Father forever and ever
Yours O LORD is the greatness The power and the glory The victory and the majesty For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours Yours is the kingdom O LORD And You are exalted as head over all
Both riches and honor come from You And You reign over all
In Your hand is power and might In Your hand it is to make great And to give strength to all
Now therefore our God We thank You And praise Your glorious name
But who am I and who are my people That we should be able to offer so willingly as this For all things come from You And of Your own we have given You
For we are aliens and pilgrims before You As were all our fathers Our days on earth are as a shadow And without hope
O LORD our God all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is from Your hand and is all Your own
I know also my God that You test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness
As for me in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things and now with joy I have seen Your people who are present here to offer willingly to You
O LORD God of Abraham Isaac and Israel our fathers keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people and fix their heart toward You
And give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your tes monies and Your statutes to do all these things and to build the temple for which I have made provision
Then David said to all the assembly Now bless the LORD your God
So all the assembly blessed the LORD God of their fathers and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and the king
And they made sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the next day a thousand bulls a thousand rams a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel
So they ate and drank before the LORD with great gladness on that day
And they made Solomon the son of David king the second me and anointed him before the LORD to be the leader and Zadok to be priest
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father and prospered and all Israel obeyed him
All the leaders and the mighty men and also all the sons of King David submi ed themselves to King Solomon
So the LORD exalted Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel
Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel
And the period that he reigned over Israel was forty years seven years he reigned in Hebron and thirty three years he reigned in Jerusalem
So he died in a good old age full of days and riches and honor and Solomon his son reigned in his place
Now the acts of King David first and last indeed they are wri en in the book of Samuel the seer in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the book of Gad the seer with all his reign and his might and the events that happened to him to Israel and to all the kingdoms of the lands
Chronicles Now Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom and the LORD his God was with him and exalted him exceedingly
And Solomon spoke to all Israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds to the judges and to every leader in all Israel the heads of the fathers houses
Then Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon for the tabernacle of mee ng with God was there which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness
But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem
Now the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the LORD Solomon and the assembly sought Him there
And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD which was at the tabernacle of mee ng and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it
On that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him Ask What shall I give you And Solomon said to God You have shown great mercy to David my father and have made me king in his place
Now O LORD God let Your promise to David my father be established for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in mul tude
Now give me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this great people of Yours And God said to Solomon Because this was in your heart and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies nor have you asked long life but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king wisdom and knowledge are granted to you and I will give you riches and wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had who were before you nor shall any a er you have the like
So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon from before the tabernacle of mee ng and reigned over Israel
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he sta oned in the chariot ci es and with the king in Jerusalem
Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland
And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh the king s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price
They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fi y thus through their agents they exported them to all the kings of the Hi tes and the kings of Syria
Then Solomon determined to build a temple for the name of the LORD and a royal house for himself
Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred to oversee them
Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre saying As you have dealt with David my father and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in so deal with me
Behold I am building a temple for the name of the LORD my God to dedicate it to Him to burn before Him sweet incense for the con nual showbread for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the Sabbaths on the New Moons and on the set feasts of the LORD our God
This is an ordinance forever to Israel
And the temple which I build will be great for our God is greater than all gods
But who is able to build Him a temple since heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him Who am I then that I should build Him a temple except to burn sacrifice before Him Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver in bronze and iron in purple and crimson and blue who has skill to engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem whom David my father provided
Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon for I know that your servants have skill to cut mber in Lebanon and indeed my servants will be with your servants to prepare mber for me in abundance for the temple which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful
And indeed I will give to your servants the woodsmen who cut mber twenty thousand kors of ground wheat twenty thousand kors of barley twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil
Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in wri ng which he sent to Solomon Because the LORD loves His people He has made you king over them
Hiram also said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who made heaven and earth for He has given King David a wise son endowed with prudence and understanding who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal house for himself And now I have sent a skillful man endowed with understanding Huram my master cra sman the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan and his father was a man of Tyre skilled to work in gold and silver bronze and iron stone and wood purple and blue fine linen and crimson and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father
Now therefore the wheat the barley the oil and the wine which my lord has spoken of let him send to his servants
And we will cut wood from Lebanon as much as you need we will bring it to you in ra s by sea to Joppa and you will carry it up to Jerusalem
Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel a er the census in which David his father had numbered them and there were found to be one hundred and fi y three thousand six hundred
And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens eighty thousand stonecu ers in the mountain and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work
Now Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the LORD had appeared to his father David at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite
And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign
This is the founda on which Solomon laid for building the house of God The length was sixty cubits by cubits according to the former measure and the width twenty cubits
And the ves bule that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house and the height was one hundred and twenty
He overlaid the inside with pure gold
The larger room he paneled with cypress which he overlaid with fine gold and he carved palm trees and chainwork on it
And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold from Parvaim
He also overlaid the house the beams and doorposts its walls and doors with gold and he carved cherubim on the walls
And he made the Most Holy Place
Its length was according to the width of the house twenty cubits and its width twenty cubits
He overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold
The weight of the nails was fi y shekels of gold and he overlaid the upper area with gold
In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim fashioned by carving and overlaid them with gold
The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in overall length one wing of the one cherub was five cubits touching the wall of the room and the other wing was five cubits touching the wing of the other cherub one wing of the other cherub was five cubits touching the wall of the room and the other wing also was five cubits touching the wing of the other cherub
The wings of these cherubim spanned twenty cubits overall
They stood on their feet and they faced inward
And he made the veil of blue purple crimson and fine linen and wove cherubim into it
Also he made in front of the temple two pillars thirty five cubits high and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits
He made wreaths of chainwork as in the inner sanctuary and put them on top of the pillars and he made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the wreaths of chainwork
Then he set up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the le he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin and the name of the one on the le Boaz
Moreover he made a bronze altar twenty cubits was its length twenty cubits its width and ten cubits its height
Then he made the Sea of cast bronze ten cubits from one brim to the other it was completely round
Its height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference
And under it was the likeness of oxen encircling it all around ten to a cubit all the way around the Sea
The oxen were cast in two rows when it was cast
It stood on twelve oxen three looking toward the north three looking toward the west three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east the Sea was set upon them and all their back parts pointed inward
It was a handbreadth thick and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup like a lily blossom
It contained three thousand baths
He also made ten lavers and put five on the right side and five on the le to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering they would wash in them but the Sea was for the priests to wash in
And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design and set them in the temple five on the right side and five on the le
He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the le
And he made one hundred bowls of gold
Furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and he overlaid these doors with bronze
He set the Sea on the right side toward the southeast
Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls
So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God the two pillars and the bowl shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars the two networks covering the two bowl shaped capitals which were on top of the pillars four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowl shaped capitals that were on the pillars he also made carts and the lavers on the carts one Sea and twelve oxen under it also the pots the shovels the forks and all their ar cles Huram his master cra sman made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD
In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds between Succoth and Zeredah
And Solomon had all these ar cles made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined
Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God the altar of gold and the tables on which was the showbread the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold to burn in the prescribed manner in front of the inner sanctuary with the flowers and the lamps and the wick trimmers of gold of purest gold the trimmers the bowls the ladles and the censers of pure gold
As for the entry of the sanctuary its inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were gold
So all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was finished and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated the silver and the gold and all the furnishings
And he put them in the treasuries of the house of God
Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief fathers of the children of Israel in Jerusalem that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD up from the City of David which is Zion
Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king at the feast which was in the seventh month
So all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the ark
Then they brought up the ark the tabernacle of mee ng and all the holy furnishings that were in the tabernacle
The priests and the Levites brought them up
Also King Solomon and all the congrega on of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for mul tude
Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place into the inner sanctuary of the temple to the Most Holy Place under the wings of the cherubim
For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles
And the poles extended so that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary but they could not be seen from outside
And they are there to this day
Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they had come out of Egypt
And it came to pass when the priests came out of the Most Holy Place for all the priests who were present had sanc fied themselves without keeping to their divisions and the Levites who were the singers all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun with their sons and their brethren stood at the east end of the altar clothed in white linen having cymbals stringed instruments and harps and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets indeed it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD and when they li ed up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised the LORD saying For He is good For His mercy endures forever that the house the house of the LORD was filled with a cloud so that the priests could not con nue ministering because of the cloud for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God
Then Solomon spoke The LORD said He would dwell in the dark cloud
I have surely built You an exalted house And a place for You to dwell in forever
Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel while all the assembly of Israel was standing
And he said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who has fulfilled with His hands what He spoke with His mouth to my father David saying Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there nor did I choose any man to be a ruler over My people Israel
Yet I have chosen Jerusalem that My name may be there and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel
Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel
But the LORD said to my father David Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name you did well in that it was in your heart
Nevertheless you shall not build the temple but your son who will come from your body he shall build the temple for My name
So the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke and I have filled the posi on of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel as the LORD promised and I have built the temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel
And there I have put the ark in which is the covenant of the LORD which He made with the children of Israel
Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands for Solomon had made a bronze pla orm five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and he stood on it knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven and he said LORD God of Israel there is no God in heaven or on earth like You who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts
You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day
Therefore LORD God of Israel now keep what You promised Your servant David my father saying You shall not fail to have a man sit before Me on the throne of Israel only if your sons take heed to their way that they walk in My law as you have walked before Me
And now O LORD God of Israel let Your word come true which You have spoken to Your servant David
But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth Behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You
How much less this temple which I have built Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplica on O LORD my God and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You that Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night toward the place where You said You would put Your name that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place
And may You hear the supplica ons of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place
Hear from heaven Your dwelling place and when You hear forgive
If anyone sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath and comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this temple then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants bringing retribu on on the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and jus fying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness
Or if Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You and return and confess Your name and pray and make supplica on before You in this temple then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land which You gave to them and their fathers
When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You when they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin because You afflict them then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants Your people Israel that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance
When there is famine in the land pes lence or blight or mildew locusts or grasshoppers when their enemies besiege them in the land of their ci es whatever plague or whatever sickness there is whatever prayer whatever supplica on is made by anyone or by all Your people Israel when each one knows his own burden and his own grief and spreads out his hands to this temple then hear from heaven Your dwelling place and forgive and give to everyone according to all his ways whose heart You know for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men that they may fear You to walk in Your ways as long as they live in the land which You gave to our fathers
Moreover concerning a foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but who comes from a far country for the sake of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm when they come and pray in this temple then hear from heaven Your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You as do Your people Israel and that they may know that this temple which I have built is called by Your name
When Your people go out to ba le against their enemies wherever You send them and when they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the temple which I have built for Your name then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplica on and maintain their cause
When they sin against You for there is no one who does not sin and You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy and they take them cap ve to a land far or near yet when they come to themselves in the land where they were carried cap ve and repent and make supplica on to You in the land of their cap vity saying We have sinned we have done wrong and have commi ed wickedness and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their cap vity where they have been carried cap ve and pray toward their land which You gave to their fathers the city which You have chosen and toward the temple which I have built for Your name then hear from heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplica ons and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You
Now my God I pray let Your eyes be open and let Your ears be a en ve to the prayer made in this place
Now therefore Arise O LORD God to Your res ng place You and the ark of Your strength
Let Your priests O LORD God be clothed with salva on And let Your saints rejoice in goodness
O LORD God do not turn away the face of Your Anointed Remember the mercies of Your servant David
When Solomon had finished praying fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the LORD filled the temple
And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD S house
When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the LORD on the temple they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and praised the LORD saying For He is good For His mercy endures forever
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep
So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God
And the priests a ended to their services the Levites also with instruments of the music of the LORD which King David had made to praise the LORD saying For His mercy endures forever whenever David offered praise by their ministry
The priests sounded trumpets opposite them while all Israel stood
Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the fat
At that me Solomon kept the feast seven days and all Israel with him a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt
And on the eighth day they held a sacred assembly for they observed the dedica on of the altar seven days and the feast seven days
On the twenty third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents joyful and glad of heart for the good that the LORD had done for David for Solomon and for His people Israel
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king s house and Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in the house of the LORD and in his own house
Then the LORD appeared to Solomon by night and said to him I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice
When I shut up heaven and there is no rain or command the locusts to devour the land or send pes lence among My people if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land
Now My eyes will be open and My ears a en ve to prayer made in this place
For now I have chosen and sanc fied this house that My name may be there forever and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually
As for you if you walk before Me as your father David walked and do according to all that I have commanded you and if you keep My statutes and My judgments then I will establish the throne of your kingdom as I covenanted with David your father saying You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel
But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you and go and serve other gods and worship them then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them and this house which I have sanc fied for My name I will cast out of My sight and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples
And as for this house which is exalted everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say Why has the LORD done thus to this land and this house Then they will answer Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt and embraced other gods and worshiped them and served them therefore He has brought all this calamity on them
It came to pass at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house that the ci es which Hiram had given to Solomon Solomon built them and he se led the children of Israel there
And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it
He also built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage ci es which he built in Hamath
He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon for fied ci es with walls gates and bars also Baalath and all the storage ci es that Solomon had and all the chariot ci es and the ci es of the cavalry and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
All the people who were le of the Hi tes Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites who were not of Israel that is their descendants who were le in the land a er them whom the children of Israel did not destroy from these Solomon raised forced labor as it is to this day
But Solomon did not make the children of Israel servants for his work
Some were men of war captains of his officers captains of his chariots and his cavalry
And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon two hundred and fi y who ruled over the people
Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her for he said My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel because the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy
Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the ves bule according to the daily rate offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths the New Moons and the three appointed yearly feasts the Feast of Unleavened Bread the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles
And according to the order of David his father he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service the Levites for their du es to praise and serve before the priests as the duty of each day required and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate for so David the man of God had commanded
They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any ma er or concerning the treasuries
Now all the work of Solomon was well ordered from the day of the founda on of the house of the LORD un l it was finished
So the house of the LORD was completed
Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast in the land of Edom
And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants and servants who knew the sea
They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and acquired four hundred and fi y talents of gold from there and brought it to King Solomon
Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard ques ons having a very great re nue camels that bore spices gold in abundance and precious stones and when she came to Solomon she spoke with him about all that was in her heart
So Solomon answered all her ques ons there was nothing so difficult for Solomon that he could not explain it to her
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon the house that he had built the food on his table the sea ng of his servants the service of his waiters and their apparel his cupbearers and their apparel and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the LORD there was no more spirit in her
Then she said to the king It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom
However I did not believe their words un l I came and saw with my own eyes and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me
You exceed the fame of which I heard
Happy are your men and happy are these your servants who stand con nually before you and hear your wisdom Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you se ng you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God Because your God has loved Israel to establish them forever therefore He made you king over them to do jus ce and righteousness
And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold spices in great abundance and precious stones there never were any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon
Also the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones
And the king made walkways of the algum wood for the house of the LORD and for the king s house also harps and stringed instruments for singers and there were none such as these seen before in the land of Judah
Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired whatever she asked much more than she had brought to the king
So she turned and went to her own country she and her servants
The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought
And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon
And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield
He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield
The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold
The throne had six steps with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the armrests
Twelve lions stood there one on each side of the six steps nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom
All King Solomon s drinking vessels were gold and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold
Not one was silver for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon
For the king s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram
Once every three years the merchant ships came bringing gold silver ivory apes and monkeys
So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart
Each man brought his present ar cles of silver and gold garments armor spices horses and mules at a set rate year by year
Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he sta oned in the chariot ci es and with the king at Jerusalem
So he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philis nes as far as the border of Egypt
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland
And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are they not wri en in the book of Nathan the prophet in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years
Then Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David his father
And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place
And Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king
So it happened when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon that Jeroboam returned from Egypt
Then they sent for him and called him
And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam saying Your father made our yoke heavy now therefore lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us and we will serve you
So he said to them Come back to me a er three days
And the people departed
Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he s ll lived saying How do you advise me to answer these people And they spoke to him saying If you are kind to these people and please them and speak good words to them they will be your servants forever
But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him who stood before him
And he said to them What advice do you give How should we answer this people who have spoken to me saying Lighten the yoke which your father put on us Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him saying Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you saying Your father made our yoke heavy but you make it lighter on us thus you shall say to them My li le finger shall be thicker than my father s waist And now whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you I will add to your yoke my father chas sed you with whips but I will chas se you with scourges So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed saying Come back to me the third day
Then the king answered them roughly
King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men saying My father made your yoke heavy but I will add to it my father chas sed you with whips but I will chas se you with scourges So the king did not listen to the people for the turn of events was from God that the LORD might fulfill His word which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them the people answered the king saying What share have we in David We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse
Every man to your tents O Israel Now see to your own house O David So all Israel departed to their tents
But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the ci es of Judah
Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram who was in charge of revenue but the children of Israel stoned him with stones and he died
Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day
Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled from the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors to fight against Israel that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God saying Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin saying Thus says the LORD You shall not go up or fight against your brethren Let every man return to his house for this thing is from Me
Therefore they obeyed the words of the LORD and turned back from a acking Jeroboam
So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem and built ci es for defense in Judah
And he built Bethlehem Etam Tekoa Beth Zur Sochoh Adullam Gath Mareshah Ziph Adoraim Lachish Azekah Zorah Aijalon and Hebron which are in Judah and Benjamin for fied ci es
And he for fied the strongholds and put captains in them and stores of food oil and wine
Also in every city he put shields and spears and made them very strong having Judah and Benjamin on his side
And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him
For the Levites le their common lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the LORD
Then he appointed for himself priests for the high places for the demons and the calf idols which he had made
And a er the Levites le those from all the tribes of Israel such as set their heart to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years
Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse
And she bore him children Jeush Shamariah and Zaham
A er her he took Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom and she bore him Abijah A ai Ziza and Shelomith
Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines and begot twenty eight sons and sixty daughters
And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief to be leader among his brothers for he intended to make him king
He dealt wisely and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin to every for fied city and he gave them provisions in abundance
He also sought many wives for them
Now it came to pass when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself that he forsook the law of the LORD and all Israel along with him
And it happened in the fi h year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem because they had transgressed against the LORD with twelve hundred chariots sixty thousand horsemen and people without number who came with him out of Egypt the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians
And he took the for fied ci es of Judah and came to Jerusalem
Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak and said to them Thus says the LORD You have forsaken Me and therefore I also have le you in the hand of Shishak
So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and they said The LORD is righteous
Now when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah saying They have humbled themselves therefore I will not destroy them but I will grant them some deliverance
My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak
Nevertheless they will be his servants that they may dis nguish My service from the service of the kingdoms of the na ons
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king s house he took everything
He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made
Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and commi ed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king s house
And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD the guard would go and bring them out then they would take them back into the guardroom
When he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him so as not to destroy him completely and things also went well in Judah
Thus Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned
Now Rehoboam was forty one years old when he became king and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there
His mother s name was Naamah an Ammonitess
And he did evil because he did not prepare his heart to seek the LORD
The acts of Rehoboam first and last are they not wri en in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days
So Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David
Then Abijah his son reigned in his place
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam Abijah became king over Judah
He reigned three years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah
And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam
Abijah set the ba le in order with an army of valiant warriors four hundred thousand choice men
Jeroboam also drew up in ba le forma on against him with eight hundred thousand choice men mighty men of valor
Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim which is in the mountains of Ephraim and said Hear me Jeroboam and all Israel Should you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel to David forever to him and his sons by a covenant of salt Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David rose up and rebelled against his lord
Then worthless rogues gathered to him and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and inexperienced and could not withstand them
And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD which is in the hand of the sons of David and you are a great mul tude and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods
Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD the sons of Aaron and the Levites and made for yourselves priests like the peoples of other lands so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of things that are not gods But as for us the LORD is our God and we have not forsaken Him and the priests who minister to the LORD are the sons of Aaron and the Levites a end to their du es
And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense they also set the showbread in order on the pure gold table and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening for we keep the command of the LORD our God but you have forsaken Him
Now look God Himself is with us as our head and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you
O children of Israel do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers for you shall not prosper But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them so they were in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them
And when Judah looked around to their surprise the ba le line was at both front and rear and they cried out to the LORD and the priests sounded the trumpets
Then the men of Judah gave a shout and as the men of Judah shouted it happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah
And the children of Israel fled before Judah and God delivered them into their hand
Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain
Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that me and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers
And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took ci es from him Bethel with its villages Jeshanah with its villages and Ephrain with its villages
So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah and the LORD struck him and he died
But Abijah grew mighty married fourteen wives and begot twenty two sons and sixteen daughters
Now the rest of the acts of Abijah his ways and his sayings are wri en in the annals of the prophet Iddo
So Abijah rested with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David
Then Asa his son reigned in his place
In his days the land was quiet for ten years
Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God for he removed the altars of the foreign gods and the high places and broke down the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images
He commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment
He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the ci es of Judah and the kingdom was quiet under him
And he built for fied ci es in Judah for the land had rest he had no war in those years because the LORD had given him rest
Therefore he said to Judah Let us build these ci es and make walls around them and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the LORD our God we have sought Him and He has given us rest on every side
So they built and prospered
And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows all these were mighty men of valor
Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots and he came to Mareshah
So Asa went out against him and they set the troops in ba le array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah
And Asa cried out to the LORD his God and said LORD it is nothing for You to help whether with many or with those who have no power help us O LORD our God for we rest on You and in Your name we go against this mul tude
O LORD You are our God do not let man prevail against You So the LORD struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah and the Ethiopians fled
And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar
So the Ethiopians were overthrown and they could not recover for they were broken before the LORD and His army
And they carried away very much spoil
Then they defeated all the ci es around Gerar for the fear of the LORD came upon them and they plundered all the ci es for there was exceedingly much spoil in them
They also a acked the livestock enclosures and carried off sheep and camels in abundance and returned to Jerusalem
Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded
And he went out to meet Asa and said to him Hear me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin
The LORD is with you while you are with Him
If you seek Him He will be found by you but if you forsake Him He will forsake you
For a long me Israel has been without the true God without a teaching priest and without law but when in their trouble they turned to the LORD God of Israel and sought Him He was found by them
And in those mes there was no peace to the one who went out nor to the one who came in but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands
So na on was destroyed by na on and city by city for God troubled them with every adversity
But you be strong and do not let your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the ci es which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim and he restored the altar of the LORD that was before the ves bule of the LORD
Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those who dwelt with them from Ephraim Manasseh and Simeon for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him
So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month in the fi eenth year of the reign of Asa
And they offered to the LORD at that me seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoil they had brought
Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul and whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel was to be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman
Then they took an oath before the LORD with a loud voice with shou ng and trumpets and rams horns
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their soul and He was found by them and the LORD gave them rest all around
Also he removed Maachah the mother of Asa the king from being queen mother because she had made an obscene image of Asherah and Asa cut down her obscene image then crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron
But the high places were not removed from Israel
Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days
He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and utensils
And there was no war un l the thirty fi h year of the reign of Asa
In the thirty sixth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah
Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king s house and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria who dwelt in Damascus saying Let there be a treaty between you and me as there was between my father and your father
Here I have sent you silver and gold come break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me
So Ben Hadad heeded King Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the ci es of Israel
They a acked Ijon Dan Abel Maim and all the storage ci es of Naphtali
Now it happened when Baasha heard it that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work
Then King Asa took all Judah and they carried away the stones and mber of Ramah which Baasha had used for building and with them he built Geba and Mizpah
And at that me Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him Because you have relied on the king of Syria and have not relied on the LORD your God therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand
Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen Yet because you relied on the LORD He delivered them into your hand
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him
In this you have done foolishly therefore from now on you shall have wars
Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison for he was enraged at him because of this
And Asa oppressed some of the people at that me
Note that the acts of Asa first and last are indeed wri en in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
And in the thirty ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet and his malady was severe yet in his disease he did not seek the LORD but the physicians
So Asa rested with his fathers he died in the forty first year of his reign
They buried him in his own tomb which he had made for himself in the City of David and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments
They made a very great burning for him
Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel
And he placed troops in all the for fied ci es of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the ci es of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken
Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the former ways of his father David he did not seek the Baals but sought the God of his father and walked in His commandments and not according to the acts of Israel
Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat and he had riches and honor in abundance
And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD moreover he removed the high places and wooden images from Judah
Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders Ben Hail Obadiah Zechariah Nethanel and Michaiah to teach in the ci es of Judah
And with them he sent Levites Shemaiah Nethaniah Zebadiah Asahel Shemiramoth Jehonathan Adonijah Tobijah and Tobadonijah the Levites and with them Elishama and Jehoram the priests
So they taught in Judah and had the Book of the Law of the LORD with them they went throughout all the ci es of Judah and taught the people
And the fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat
Also some of the Philis nes brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute and the Arabians brought him flocks seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats
So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful and he built fortresses and storage ci es in Judah
He had much property in the ci es of Judah and the men of war mighty men of valor were in Jerusalem
These are their numbers according to their fathers houses
Of Judah the captains of thousands Adnah the captain and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor and next to him was Jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and eighty thousand and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri who willingly offered himself to the LORD and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor
Of Benjamin Eliada a mighty man of valor and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield and next to him was Jehozabad and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war
These served the king besides those the king put in the for fied ci es throughout all Judah
Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance and by marriage he allied himself with Ahab
A er some years he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people who were with him and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead
So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead And he answered him I am as you are and my people as your people we will be with you in the war
And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel Please inquire for the word of the LORD today
Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together four hundred men and said to them Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead or shall I refrain And they said Go up for God will deliver it into the king s hand
But Jehoshaphat said Is there not s ll a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of Him So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is s ll one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD but I hate him because he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil
He is Micaiah the son of Imla
And Jehoshaphat said Let not the king say such things Then the king of Israel called one of his officers and said Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah clothed in their robes sat each on his throne and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself and he said Thus says the LORD With these you shall gore the Syrians un l they are destroyed
And all the prophets prophesied so saying Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper for the LORD will deliver it into the king s hand
Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him saying Now listen the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king
Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them and speak encouragement
And Micaiah said As the LORD lives whatever my God says that I will speak
Then he came to the king and the king said to him Micaiah shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead or shall I refrain And he said Go and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand So the king said to him How many mes shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD Then he said I saw all Israel sca ered on the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd
And the LORD said These have no master
Let each return to his house in peace
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil Then Micaiah said Therefore hear the word of the LORD I saw the LORD si ng on His throne and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His le
And the LORD said Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead So one spoke in this manner and another spoke in that manner
Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said I will persuade him
The LORD said to him In what way So he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
And the LORD said You shall persuade him and also prevail go out and do so
Therefore look The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours and the LORD has declared disaster against you
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you And Micaiah said Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide Then the king of Israel said Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king s son and say Thus says the king Put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread of afflic on and water of afflic on un l I return in peace
Then Micaiah said If you ever return in peace the LORD has not spoken by me
And he said Take heed all you people So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat I will disguise myself and go into ba le but you put on your robes
So the king of Israel disguised himself and they went into ba le
Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were with him saying Fight with no one small or great but only with the king of Israel
So it was when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said It is the king of Israel Therefore they surrounded him to a ack but Jehoshaphat cried out and the LORD helped him and God diverted them from him
For so it was when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel that they turned back from pursuing him
Now a certain man drew a bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor
So he said to the driver of his chariot Turn around and take me out of the ba le for I am wounded
The ba le increased that day and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Syrians un l evening and about the me of sunset he died
Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD Therefore the wrath of the LORD is upon you
Nevertheless good things are found in you in that you have removed the wooden images from the land and have prepared your heart to seek God
So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers
Then he set judges in the land throughout all the for fied ci es of Judah city by city and said to the judges Take heed to what you are doing for you do not judge for man but for the LORD who is with you in the judgment
Now therefore let the fear of the LORD be upon you take care and do it for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God no par ality nor taking of bribes
Moreover in Jerusalem for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests and some of the chief fathers of Israel when they returned to Jerusalem
And he commanded them saying Thus you shall act in the fear of the LORD faithfully and with a loyal heart Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their ci es whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment against statutes or ordinances you shall warn them lest they trespass against the LORD and wrath come upon you and your brethren
Do this and you will not be guilty
And take no ce Amariah the chief priest is over you in all ma ers of the LORD and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the ruler of the house of Judah for all the king s ma ers also the Levites will be officials before you
Behave courageously and the LORD will be with the good
It happened a er this that the people of Moab with the people of Ammon and others with them besides the Ammonites came to ba le against Jehoshaphat
Then some came and told Jehoshaphat saying A great mul tude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria and they are in Hazazon Tamar which is En Gedi
And Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the LORD and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah
So Judah gathered together to ask help from the LORD and from all the ci es of Judah they came to seek the LORD
Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD before the new court and said O LORD God of our fathers are You not God in heaven and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the na ons and in Your hand is there not power and might so that no one is able to withstand You Are You not our God who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and gave it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever And they dwell in it and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name saying If disaster comes upon us sword judgment pes lence or famine we will stand before this temple and in Your presence for Your name is in this temple and cry out to You in our afflic on and You will hear and save
And now here are the people of Ammon Moab and Mount Seir whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and did not destroy them here they are rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit
O our God will You not judge them For we have no power against this great mul tude that is coming against us nor do we know what to do but our eyes are upon You
Now all Judah with their li le ones their wives and their children stood before the LORD
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah the son of Benaiah the son of Jeiel the son of Ma aniah a Levite of the sons of Asaph in the midst of the assembly
And he said Listen all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem and you King Jehoshaphat Thus says the LORD to you Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great mul tude for the ba le is not yours but God s
Tomorrow go down against them
They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel
You will not need to fight in this ba le
Posi on yourselves stand s ll and see the salva on of the LORD who is with you O Judah and Jerusalem Do not fear or be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the LORD is with you
And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the LORD worshiping the LORD
Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with voices loud and high
So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa and as they went out Jehoshaphat stood and said Hear me O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem Believe in the LORD your God and you shall be established believe His prophets and you shall prosper
And when he had consulted with the people he appointed those who should sing to the LORD and who should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and were saying Praise the LORD For His mercy endures forever
Now when they began to sing and to praise the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon Moab and Mount Seir who had come against Judah and they were defeated
For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to u erly kill and destroy them
And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir they helped to destroy one another
So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness they looked toward the mul tude and there were their dead bodies fallen on the earth
No one had escaped
When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies and precious jewelry which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much
And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah for there they blessed the LORD therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah un l this day
Then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them to go back to Jerusalem with joy for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies
So they came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to the house of the LORD
And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel
Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet for his God gave him rest all around
So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah
He was thirty five years old when he became king and he reigned twenty five years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
And he walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it doing what was right in the sight of the LORD
Nevertheless the high places were not taken away for as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat first and last indeed they are wri en in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani which is men oned in the book of the kings of Israel
A er this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel who acted very wickedly
And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish and they made the ships in Ezion Geber
But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah the LORD has destroyed your works
Then the ships were wrecked so that they were not able to go to Tarshish
And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the City of David
Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place
He had brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat Azariah Jehiel Zechariah Azaryahu Michael and Shepha ah all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel
Their father gave them great gi s of silver and gold and precious things with for fied ci es in Judah but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn
Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword and also others of the princes of Israel
Jehoram was thirty two years old when he became king and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel just as the house of Ahab had done for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife and he did evil in the sight of the LORD
Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant that He had made with David and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever
In his days the Edomites revolted against Judah s authority and made a king over themselves
So Jehoram went out with his officers and all his chariots with him
And he rose by night and a acked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots
Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah s authority to this day
At that me Libnah revolted against his rule because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry and led Judah astray
And a le er came to him from Elijah the prophet saying Thus says the LORD God of your father David Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father or in the ways of Asa king of Judah but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab and also have killed your brothers those of your father s household who were be er than yourself behold the LORD will strike your people with a serious afflic on your children your wives and all your possessions and you will become very sick with a disease of your intes nes un l your intes nes come out by reason of the sickness day by day
Moreover the LORD s rred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philis nes and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians
And they came up into Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king s house and also his sons and his wives so that there was not a son le to him except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons
A er all this the LORD struck him in his intes nes with an incurable disease
Then it happened in the course of me a er the end of two years that his intes nes came out because of his sickness so he died in severe pain
And his people made no burning for him like the burning for his fathers
He was thirty two years old when he became king
He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and to no one s sorrow departed
However they buried him in the City of David but not in the tombs of the kings
Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed all the older sons
So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned
Ahaziah was forty two years old when he became king and he reigned one year in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab for his mother advised him to do wickedly
Therefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab for they were his counselors a er the death of his father to his destruc on
He also followed their advice and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead and the Syrians wounded Joram
Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria
And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick
His going to Joram was God s occasion for Ahaziah s downfall for when he arrived he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab
And it happened when Jehu was execu ng judgment on the house of Ahab and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah s brothers who served Ahaziah that he killed them
Then he searched for Ahaziah and they caught him he was hiding in Samaria and brought him to Jehu
When they had killed him they buried him because they said he is the son of Jehoshaphat who sought the LORD with all his heart
So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom
Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah
But Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king s sons who were being murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom
So Jehoshabeath the daughter of King Jehoram the wife of Jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of Ahaziah hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him
And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years while Athaliah reigned over the land
In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and made a covenant with the captains of hundreds Azariah the son of Jeroham Ishmael the son of Jehohanan Azariah the son of Obed Maaseiah the son of Adaiah and Elishaphat the son of Zichri
And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the ci es of Judah and the chief fathers of Israel and they came to Jerusalem
Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God
And he said to them Behold the king s son shall reign as the LORD has said of the sons of David
This is what you shall do One third of you entering on the Sabbath of the priests and the Levites shall be keeping watch over the doors one third shall be at the king s house and one third at the Gate of the Founda on
All the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD
But let no one come into the house of the LORD except the priests and those of the Levites who serve
They may go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD
And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides every man with his weapons in his hand and whoever comes into the house let him be put to death
You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out
So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded
And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions
And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had belonged to King David that were in the temple of God
Then he set all the people every man with his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the le side of the temple along by the altar and by the temple all around the king
And they brought out the king s son put the crown on him gave him the Tes mony and made him king
Then Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said Long live the king Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people in the temple of the LORD
When she looked there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king
All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets also the singers with musical instruments and those who led in praise
So Athaliah tore her clothes and said Treason Treason And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army and said to them Take her outside under guard and slay with the sword whoever follows her
For the priest had said Do not kill her in the house of the LORD
So they seized her and she went by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate into the king s house and they killed her there
Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself the people and the king that they should be the LORD S people
And all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down
They broke in pieces its altars and images and killed Ma an the priest of Baal before the altars
Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the LORD to the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had assigned in the house of the LORD to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD as it is wri en in the Law of Moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was established by David
And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one who was in any way unclean should enter
Then he took the captains of hundreds the nobles the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the house of the LORD and they went through the Upper Gate to the king s house and set the king on the throne of the kingdom
So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet for they had slain Athaliah with the sword
Joash was seven years old when he became king and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Zibiah of Beersheba
Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest
And Jehoiada took two wives for him and he had sons and daughters
Now it happened a er this that Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD
Then he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them Go out to the ci es of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year and see that you do it quickly
However the Levites did not do it quickly
So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collec on according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD and of the assembly of Israel for the tabernacle of witness For the sons of Athaliah that wicked woman had broken into the house of God and had also presented all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD to the Baals
Then at the king s command they made a chest and set it outside at the gate of the house of the LORD
And they made a proclama on throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the collec on that Moses the servant of God had imposed on Israel in the wilderness
Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced brought their contribu ons and put them into the chest un l all had given
So it was at that me when the chest was brought to the king s official by the hand of the Levites and when they saw that there was much money that the king s scribe and the high priest s officer came and emp ed the chest and took it and returned it to its place
Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance
The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the LORD
So the workmen labored and the work was completed by them they restored the house of God to its original condi on and reinforced it
When they had finished they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada they made from it ar cles for the house of the LORD ar cles for serving and offering spoons and vessels of gold and silver
And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD con nually all the days of Jehoiada
But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days and he died he was one hundred and thirty years old when he died
And they buried him in the City of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel both toward God and His house
Now a er the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king
And the king listened to them
Therefore they le the house of the LORD God of their fathers and served wooden images and idols and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass
Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the LORD and they tes fied against them but they would not listen
Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest who stood above the people and said to them Thus says God Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper Because you have forsaken the LORD He also has forsaken you
So they conspired against him and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD
Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him but killed his son and as he died he said The LORD look on it and repay So it happened in the spring of the year that the army of Syria came up against him and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men but the LORD delivered a very great army into their hand because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers
So they executed judgment against Joash
And when they had withdrawn from him for they le him severely wounded his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and killed him on his bed
So he died
And they buried him in the City of David but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings
These are the ones who conspired against him Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess
Now concerning his sons and the many oracles about him and the repairing of the house of God indeed they are wri en in the annals of the book of the kings
Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place
Amaziah was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD but not with a loyal heart
Now it happened as soon as the kingdom was established for him that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king
However he did not execute their children but did as it is wri en in the Law in the Book of Moses where the LORD commanded saying The fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers but a person shall die for his own sin
Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds according to their fathers houses throughout all Judah and Benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men able to go to war who could handle spear and shield
He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver
But a man of God came to him saying O king do not let the army of Israel go with you for the LORD is not with Israel not with any of the children of Ephraim
But if you go be gone Be strong in ba le Even so God shall make you fall before the enemy for God has power to help and to overthrow
Then Amaziah said to the man of God But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel And the man of God answered The LORD is able to give you much more than this
So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim to go back home
Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah and they returned home in great anger
Then Amaziah strengthened himself and leading his people he went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir
Also the children of Judah took cap ve ten thousand alive brought them to the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock so that they all were dashed in pieces
But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged so that they would not go with him to ba le they raided the ci es of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon killed three thousand in them and took much spoil
Now it was so a er Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites that he brought the gods of the people of Seir set them up to be his gods and bowed down before them and burned incense to them
Therefore the anger of the LORD was aroused against Amaziah and He sent him a prophet who said to him Why have you sought the gods of the people which could not rescue their own people from your hand So it was as he talked with him that the king said to him Have we made you the king s counselor Cease Why should you be killed Then the prophet ceased and said I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not heeded my advice
Now Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us face one another in ba le
And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon saying Give your daughter to my son as wife and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle
Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites and your heart is li ed up to boast
Stay at home now why should you meddle with trouble that you should fall you and Judah with you But Amaziah would not heed for it came from God that He might give them into the hand of their enemies because they sought the gods of Edom
So Joash king of Israel went out and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh which belongs to Judah
And Judah was defeated by Israel and every man fled to his tent
Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz at Beth Shemesh and he brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate four hundred cubits
And he took all the gold and silver all the ar cles that were found in the house of God with Obed Edom the treasures of the king s house and hostages and returned to Samaria
Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fi een years a er the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah from first to last indeed are they not wri en in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel A er the me that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish but they sent a er him to Lachish and killed him there
Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah
Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king instead of his father Amaziah
He built Elath and restored it to Judah a er the king rested with his fathers
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king and he reigned fi y two years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Amaziah had done
He sought God in the days of Zechariah who had understanding in the visions of God and as long as he sought the LORD God made him prosper
Now he went out and made war against the Philis nes and broke down the wall of Gath the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod and he built ci es around Ashdod and among the Philis nes
God helped him against the Philis nes against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites
Also the Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah
His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt for he became exceedingly strong
And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate at the Valley Gate and at the corner bu ress of the wall then he for fied them
Also he built towers in the desert
He dug many wells for he had much livestock both in the lowlands and in the plains he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel for he loved the soil
Moreover Uzziah had an army of figh ng men who went out to war by companies according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the hand of Hananiah one of the king s captains
The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred
And under their authority was an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy
Then Uzziah prepared for them for the en re army shields spears helmets body armor bows and slings to cast stones
And he made devices in Jerusalem invented by skillful men to be on the towers and the corners to shoot arrows and large stones
So his fame spread far and wide for he was marvelously helped ll he became strong
But when he was strong his heart was li ed up to his destruc on for he transgressed against the LORD his God by entering the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense
So Azariah the priest went in a er him and with him were eighty priests of the LORD valiant men
And they withstood King Uzziah and said to him It is not for you Uzziah to burn incense to the LORD but for the priests the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense
Get out of the sanctuary for you have trespassed You shall have no honor from the LORD God
Then Uzziah became furious and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense
And while he was angry with the priests leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD beside the incense altar
And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him and there on his forehead he was leprous so they thrust him out of that place
Indeed he also hurried to get out because the LORD had struck him
King Uzziah was a leper un l the day of his death
He dwelt in an isolated house because he was a leper for he was cut off from the house of the LORD
Then Jotham his son was over the king s house judging the people of the land
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah from first to last the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz wrote
So Uzziah rested with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings for they said He is a leper
Then Jotham his son reigned in his place
Jotham was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah had done although he did not enter the temple of the LORD
But s ll the people acted corruptly
He built the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel
Moreover he built ci es in the mountains of Judah and in the forests he built fortresses and towers
He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and defeated them
And the people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver ten thousand kors of wheat and ten thousand of barley
The people of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also
So Jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways indeed they are wri en in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
He was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem
So Jotham rested with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David
Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD as his father David had done
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and made molded images for the Baals
He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned his children in the fire according to the abomina ons of the na ons whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places on the hills and under every green tree
Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria
They defeated him and carried away a great mul tude of them as cap ves and brought them to Damascus
Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel who defeated him with a great slaughter
For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day all valiant men because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers
Zichri a mighty man of Ephraim killed Maaseiah the king s son Azrikam the officer over the house and Elkanah who was second to the king
And the children of Israel carried away cap ve of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and they also took away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria
But a prophet of the LORD was there whose name was Oded and he went out before the army that came to Samaria and said to them Look because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah He has delivered them into your hand but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to heaven
And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves but are you not also guilty before the LORD your God Now hear me therefore and return the cap ves whom you have taken cap ve from your brethren for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you
Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim Azariah the son of Johanan Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah the son of Shallum and Amasa the son of Hadlai stood up against those who came from the war and said to them You shall not bring the cap ves here for we already have offended the LORD
You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt for our guilt is great and there is fierce wrath against Israel
So the armed men le the cap ves and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly
Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the cap ves and from the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them dressed them and gave them sandals gave them food and drink and anointed them and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys
So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho the city of palm trees
Then they returned to Samaria
At the same me King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him
For again the Edomites had come a acked Judah and carried away cap ves
The Philis nes also had invaded the ci es of the lowland and of the South of Judah and had taken Beth Shemesh Aijalon Gederoth Sochoh with its villages Timnah with its villages and Gimzo with its villages and they dwelt there
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel for he had encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been con nually unfaithful to the LORD
Also Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him and did not assist him
For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of the LORD from the house of the king and from the leaders and he gave it to the king of Assyria but he did not help him
Now in the me of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the LORD
This is that King Ahaz
For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him saying Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them I will sacrifice to them that they may help me
But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel
So Ahaz gathered the ar cles of the house of God cut in pieces the ar cles of the house of God shut up the doors of the house of the LORD and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem
And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers
Now the rest of his acts and all his ways from first to last indeed they are wri en in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
So Ahaz rested with his fathers and they buried him in the city in Jerusalem but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel
Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place
Hezekiah became king when he was twenty five years old and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem
His mother s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father David had done
In the first year of his reign in the first month he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them
Then he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them in the East Square and said to them Hear me Levites Now sanc fy yourselves sanc fy the house of the LORD God of your fathers and carry out the rubbish from the holy place
For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the LORD our God they have forsaken Him have turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD and turned their backs on Him
They have also shut up the doors of the ves bule put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel
Therefore the wrath of the LORD fell upon Judah and Jerusalem and He has given them up to trouble to desola on and to jeering as you see with your eyes
For indeed because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons our daughters and our wives are in cap vity
Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel that His fierce wrath may turn away from us
My sons do not be negligent now for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him to serve Him and that you should minister to Him and burn incense
Then these Levites arose Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah of the sons of the Kohathites of the sons of Merari Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel of the Gershonites Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah of the sons of Elizaphan Shimri and Jeiel of the sons of Asaph Zechariah and Ma aniah of the sons of Heman Jehiel and Shimei and of the sons of Jeduthun Shemaiah and Uzziel
And they gathered their brethren sanc fied themselves and went according to the commandment of the king at the words of the LORD to cleanse the house of the LORD
Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of the LORD to the court of the house of the LORD
And the Levites took it out and carried it to the Brook Kidron
Now they began to sanc fy on the first day of the first month and on the eighth day of the month they came to the ves bule of the LORD
Then they sanc fied the house of the LORD in eight days and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished
Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said We have cleansed all the house of the LORD the altar of burnt offerings with all its ar cles and the table of the showbread with all its ar cles
Moreover all the ar cles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and sanc fied and there they are before the altar of the LORD
Then King Hezekiah rose early gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the LORD
And they brought seven bulls seven rams seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom for the sanctuary and for Judah
Then he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD
So they killed the bulls and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar
Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar
They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar
Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly and they laid their hands on them
And the priests killed them and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make an atonement for all Israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel
And he sta oned the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals with stringed instruments and with harps according to the commandment of David of Gad the king s seer and of Nathan the prophet for thus was the commandment of the LORD by His prophets
The Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets
Then Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar
And when the burnt offering began the song of the LORD also began with the trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel
So all the assembly worshiped the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded all this con nued un l the burnt offering was finished
And when they had finished offering the king and all who were present with him bowed and worshiped
Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer
So they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshiped
Then Hezekiah answered and said Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD
So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings
And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls one hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD
The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep
But the priests were too few so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings therefore their brethren the Levites helped them un l the work was ended and un l the other priests had sanc fied themselves for the Levites were more diligent in sanc fying themselves than the priests
Also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering
So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order
Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people since the events took place so suddenly
And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and also wrote le ers to Ephraim and Manasseh that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the LORD God of Israel
For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to keep the Passover in the second month
For they could not keep it at the regular me because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem
And the ma er pleased the king and all the assembly
So they resolved to make a proclama on throughout all Israel from Beersheba to Dan that they should come to keep the Passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem since they had not done it for a long me in the prescribed manner
Then the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the le ers from the king and his leaders and spoke according to the command of the king Children of Israel return to the LORD God of Abraham Isaac and Israel then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria
And do not be like your fathers and your brethren who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers so that He gave them up to desola on as you see
Now do not be s ff necked as your fathers were but yield yourselves to the LORD and enter His sanctuary which He has sanc fied forever and serve the LORD your God that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you
For if you return to the LORD your brethren and your children will be treated with compassion by those who lead them cap ve so that they may come back to this land for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him
So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun but they laughed at them and mocked them
Nevertheless some from Asher Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem
Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the leaders at the word of the LORD
Now many people a very great assembly gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month
They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron
Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month
The priests and the Levites were ashamed and sanc fied themselves and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the LORD
They stood in their place according to their custom according to the Law of Moses the man of God the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites
For there were many in the assembly who had not sanc fied themselves therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean to sanc fy them to the LORD
For a mul tude of the people many from Ephraim Manasseh Issachar and Zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was wri en
But Hezekiah prayed for them saying May the good LORD provide atonement for everyone who prepares his heart to seek God the LORD God of his fathers though he is not cleansed according to the purifica on of the sanctuary
And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people
So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day singing to the LORD accompanied by loud instruments
And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD and they ate throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers
Then the whole assembly agreed to keep the feast another seven days and they kept it another seven days with gladness
For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanc fied themselves
The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced also the priests and Levites all the assembly that came from Israel the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those who dwelt in Judah
So there was great joy in Jerusalem for since the me of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem
Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place to heaven
Now when all this was finished all Israel who were present went out to the ci es of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces cut down the wooden images and threw down the high places and the altars from all Judah Benjamin Ephraim and Manasseh un l they had u erly destroyed them all
Then all the children of Israel returned to their own ci es every man to his possession
And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions each man according to his service the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings to serve to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD
The king also appointed a por on of his possessions for the burnt offerings for the morning and evening burnt offerings the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the New Moons and the set feasts as it is wri en in the Law of the LORD
Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support for the priests and the Levites that they might devote themselves to the Law of the LORD
As soon as the commandment was circulated the children of Israel brought in abundance the firs ruits of grain and wine oil and honey and of all the produce of the field and they brought in abundantly the the of everything
And the children of Israel and Judah who dwelt in the ci es of Judah brought the the of oxen and sheep also the the of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God they laid in heaps
In the third month they began laying them in heaps and they finished in the seventh month
And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps they blessed the LORD and His people Israel
Then Hezekiah ques oned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps
And Azariah the chief priest from the house of Zadok answered him and said Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD we have had enough to eat and have plenty le for the LORD has blessed His people and what is le is this great abundance
Now Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the LORD and they prepared them
Then they faithfully brought in the offerings the thes and the dedicated things Cononiah the Levite had charge of them and Shimei his brother was the next
Jehiel Azaziah Nahath Asahel Jerimoth Jozabad Eliel Ismachiah Mahath and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God
Kore the son of Imnah the Levite the keeper of the East Gate was over the freewill offerings to God to distribute the offerings of the LORD and the most holy things
And under him were Eden Miniamin Jeshua Shemaiah Amariah and Shecaniah his faithful assistants in the ci es of the priests to distribute allotments to their brethren by divisions to the great as well as the small
Besides those males from three years old and up who were wri en in the genealogy they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the LORD his daily por on for the work of his service by his division and to the priests who were wri en in the genealogy according to their father s house and to the Levites from twenty years old and up according to their work by their divisions and to all who were wri en in the genealogy their li le ones and their wives their sons and daughters the whole company of them for in their faithfulness they sanc fied themselves in holiness
Also for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the fields of the common lands of their ci es in every single city there were men who were designated by name to distribute por ons to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites
Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah and he did what was good and right and true before the LORD his God
And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God in the law and in the commandment to seek his God he did it with all his heart
So he prospered
A er these deeds of faithfulness Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah he encamped against the for fied ci es thinking to win them over to himself
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem he consulted with his leaders and commanders to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city and they helped him
Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook that ran through the land saying Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water And he strengthened himself built up all the wall that was broken raised it up to the towers and built another wall outside also he repaired the Millo in the City of David and made weapons and shields in abundance
Then he set military captains over the people gathered them together to him in the open square of the city gate and gave them encouragement saying Be strong and courageous do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria nor before all the mul tude that is with him for there are more with us than with him
With him is an arm of flesh but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our ba les
And the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah
A er this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem saying Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria In what do you trust that you remain under siege in Jerusalem Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst saying The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on it Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands Were the gods of the na ons of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand Who was there among all the gods of those na ons that my fathers u erly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this and do not believe him for no god of any na on or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers
How much less will your God deliver you from my hand Furthermore his servants spoke against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah
He also wrote le ers to revile the LORD God of Israel and to speak against Him saying As the gods of the na ons of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand
Then they called out with a loud voice in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to frighten them and trouble them that they might take the city
And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth the work of men s hands
Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried out to heaven
Then the LORD sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria
So he returned shamefaced to his own land
And when he had gone into the temple of his god some of his own offspring struck him down with the sword there
Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others and guided them on every side
And many brought gi s to the LORD at Jerusalem and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah so that he was exalted in the sight of all na ons therea er
In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death and he prayed to the LORD and He spoke to him and gave him a sign
But Hezekiah did not repay according to the favor shown him for his heart was li ed up therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem
Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah
Hezekiah had very great riches and honor
And he made himself treasuries for silver for gold for precious stones for spices for shields and for all kinds of desirable items storehouses for the harvest of grain wine and oil and stalls for all kinds of livestock and folds for flocks
Moreover he provided ci es for himself and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for God had given him very much property
This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David
Hezekiah prospered in all his works
However regarding the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon whom they sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land God withdrew from him in order to test him that He might know all that was in his heart
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness indeed they are wri en in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
So Hezekiah rested with his fathers and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death
Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he reigned fi y five years in Jerusalem
But he did evil in the sight of the LORD according to the abomina ons of the na ons whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down he raised up altars for the Baals and made wooden images and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them
He also built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD had said In Jerusalem shall My name be forever
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom he prac ced soothsaying used witchcra and sorcery and consulted mediums and spiri sts
He did much evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger
He even set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of God of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel I will put My name forever and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses
So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the na ons whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel
And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people but they would not listen
Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria who took Manasseh with hooks bound him with bronze fe ers and carried him off to Babylon
Now when he was in afflic on he implored the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers and prayed to Him and He received his entreaty heard his supplica on and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom
Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God
A er this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon in the valley as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and it enclosed Ophel and he raised it to a very great height
Then he put military captains in all the for fied ci es of Judah
He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem and he cast them out of the city
He also repaired the altar of the LORD sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel
Nevertheless the people s ll sacrificed on the high places but only to the LORD their God
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel indeed they are wri en in the book of the kings of Israel
Also his prayer and how God received his entreaty and all his sin and trespass and the sites where he built high places and set up wooden images and carved images before he was humbled indeed they are wri en among the sayings of Hozai
So Manasseh rested with his fathers and they buried him in his own house
Then his son Amon reigned in his place
Amon was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned two years in Jerusalem
But he did evil in the sight of the LORD as his father Manasseh had done for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made and served them
And he did not humble himself before the LORD as his father Manasseh had humbled himself but Amon trespassed more and more
Then his servants conspired against him and killed him in his own house
But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon
Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place
Josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned thirty one years in Jerusalem
And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the le
For in the eighth year of his reign while he was s ll young he began to seek the God of his father David and in the twel h year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places the wooden images the carved images and the molded images
They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence and the incense altars which were above them he cut down and the wooden images the carved images and the molded images he broke in pieces and made dust of them and sca ered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them
He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem
And so he did in the ci es of Manasseh Ephraim and Simeon as far as Naphtali and all around with axes
When he had broken down the altars and the wooden images had beaten the carved images into powder and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel he returned to Jerusalem
In the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the temple he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah Maaseiah the governor of the city and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the LORD his God
When they came to Hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim from all the remnant of Israel from all Judah and Benjamin and which they had brought back to Jerusalem
Then they put it in the hand of the foremen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of the LORD to repair and restore the house
They gave it to the cra smen and builders to buy hewn stone and mber for beams and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed
And the men did the work faithfully
Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites of the sons of Merari and Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites to supervise
Others of the Levites all of whom were skillful with instruments of music were over the burden bearers and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service
And some of the Levites were scribes officers and gatekeepers
Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given by Moses
Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD
And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan
So Shaphan carried the book to the king bringing the king word saying All that was commi ed to your servants they are doing
And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king saying Hilkiah the priest has given me a book
And Shaphan read it before the king
Thus it happened when the king heard the words of the Law that he tore his clothes
Then the king commanded Hilkiah Ahikam the son of Shaphan Abdon the son of Micah Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah a servant of the king saying Go inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are le in Israel and Judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD to do according to all that is wri en in this book
So Hilkiah and those the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath the son of Hasrah keeper of the wardrobe
She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter
And they spoke to her to that effect
Then she answered them Thus says the LORD God of Israel Tell the man who sent you to Me Thus says the LORD Behold I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants all the curses that are wri en in the book which they have read before the king of Judah because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands
Therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place and not be quenched
But as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD in this manner you shall speak to him Thus says the LORD God of Israel Concerning the words which you have heard because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants and you humbled yourself before Me and you tore your clothes and wept before Me I also have heard you says the LORD
Surely I will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place and its inhabitants
So they brought back word to the king
Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem
The king went up to the house of the LORD with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the priests and the Levites and all the people great and small
And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD
Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments and His tes monies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul to perform the words of the covenant that were wri en in this book
And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand
So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God the God of their fathers
Thus Josiah removed all the abomina ons from all the country that belonged to the children of Israel and made all who were present in Israel diligently serve the LORD their God
All his days they did not depart from following the LORD God of their fathers
Now Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem and they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month
And he set the priests in their du es and encouraged them for the service of the house of the LORD
Then he said to the Levites who taught all Israel who were holy to the LORD Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built
It shall no longer be a burden on your shoulders
Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel
Prepare yourselves according to your fathers houses according to your divisions following the wri en instruc on of David king of Israel and the wri en instruc on of Solomon his son
And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brethren the lay people and according to the division of the father s house of the Levites
So slaughter the Passover offerings consecrate yourselves and prepare them for your brethren that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses
Then Josiah gave the lay people lambs and young goats from the flock all for Passover offerings for all who were present to the number of thirty thousand as well as three thousand ca le these were from the king s possessions
And his leaders gave willingly to the people to the priests and to the Levites
Hilkiah Zechariah and Jehiel rulers of the house of God gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred from the flock and three hundred ca le
Also Conaniah his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad chief of the Levites gave to the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand from the flock and five hundred ca le
So the service was prepared and the priests stood in their places and the Levites in their divisions according to the king s command
And they slaughtered the Passover offerings and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hands while the Levites skinned the animals
Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers houses of the lay people to offer to the LORD as it is wri en in the Book of Moses
And so they did with the ca le
Also they roasted the Passover offerings with fire according to the ordinance but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots in caldrons and in pans and divided them quickly among all the lay people
Then a erward they prepared por ons for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat un l night therefore the Levites prepared por ons for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron
And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their places according to the command of David Asaph Heman and Jeduthun the king s seer
Also the gatekeepers were at each gate they did not have to leave their posi on because their brethren the Levites prepared por ons for them
So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD according to the command of King Josiah
And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that me and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days
There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept with the priests and the Levites all Judah and Israel who were present and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept
A er all this when Josiah had prepared the temple Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates and Josiah went out against him
But he sent messengers to him saying What have I to do with you king of Judah I have not come against you this day but against the house with which I have war for God commanded me to make haste
Refrain from meddling with God who is with me lest He destroy you
Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself so that he might fight with him and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God
So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo
And the archers shot King Josiah and the king said to his servants Take me away for I am severely wounded
His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to Jerusalem
So he died and was buried in one of the tombs of his fathers
And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah
Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah
And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamenta ons
They made it a custom in Israel and indeed they are wri en in the Laments
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness according to what was wri en in the Law of the LORD and his deeds from first to last indeed they are wri en in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in his father s place in Jerusalem
Jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king and he reigned three months in Jerusalem
Now the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
Then the king of Egypt made Jehoahaz s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed his name to Jehoiakim
And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him off to Egypt
Jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and bound him in bronze fe ers to carry him off to Babylon
Nebuchadnezzar also carried off some of the ar cles from the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his temple at Babylon
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim the abomina ons which he did and what was found against him indeed they are wri en in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD
At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar summoned him and took him to Babylon with the costly ar cles from the house of the LORD and made Zedekiah Jehoiakim s brother king over Judah and Jerusalem
Zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
He did evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke from the mouth of the LORD
And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear an oath by God but he s ffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD God of Israel
Moreover all the leaders of the priests and the people transgressed more and more according to all the abomina ons of the na ons and defiled the house of the LORD which He had consecrated in Jerusalem
And the LORD God of their fathers sent warnings to them by His messengers rising up early and sending them because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place
But they mocked the messengers of God despised His words and scoffed at His prophets un l the wrath of the LORD arose against His people ll there was no remedy
Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion on young man or virgin on the aged or the weak He gave them all into his hand
And all the ar cles from the house of God great and small the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king and of his leaders all these he took to Babylon
Then they burned the house of God broke down the wall of Jerusalem burned all its palaces with fire and destroyed all its precious possessions
And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon where they became servants to him and his sons un l the rule of the kingdom of Persia to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah un l the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths
As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath to fulfill seventy years
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the LORD s rred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclama on throughout all his kingdom and also put it in wri ng saying Thus says Cyrus king of Persia All the kingdoms of the earth the LORD God of heaven has given me
And He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah
Who is among you of all His people May the LORD his God be with him and let him go up Ezra Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the LORD s rred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclama on throughout all his kingdom and also put it in wri ng saying Thus says Cyrus king of Persia All the kingdoms of the earth the LORD God of heaven has given me
And He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah
Who is among you of all His people May his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the LORD God of Israel He is God which is in Jerusalem
And whoever is le in any place where he dwells let the men of his place help him with silver and gold with goods and livestock besides the freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem
Then the heads of the fathers houses of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all whose spirits God had moved arose to go up and build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem
And all those who were around them encouraged them with ar cles of silver and gold with goods and livestock and with precious things besides all that was willingly offered
King Cyrus also brought out the ar cles of the house of the LORD which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put in the temple of his gods and Cyrus king of Persia brought them out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer and counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah
This is the number of them thirty gold pla ers one thousand silver pla ers twenty nine knives thirty gold basins four hundred and ten silver basins of a similar kind and one thousand other ar cles
All the ar cles of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred
All these Sheshbazzar took with the cap ves who were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem
Now these are the people of the province who came back from the cap vity of those who had been carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah everyone to his own city
Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua Nehemiah Seraiah Reelaiah Mordecai Bilshan Mispar Bigvai Rehum and Baanah
The number of the men of the people of Israel the people of Parosh two thousand one hundred and seventy two the people of Shepha ah three hundred and seventy two the people of Arah seven hundred and seventy five the people of Pahath Moab of the people of Jeshua and Joab two thousand eight hundred and twelve the people of Elam one thousand two hundred and fi y four the people of Za u nine hundred and forty five the people of Zaccai seven hundred and sixty the people of Bani six hundred and forty two the people of Bebai six hundred and twenty three the people of Azgad one thousand two hundred and twenty two the people of Adonikam six hundred and sixty six the people of Bigvai two thousand and fi y six the people of Adin four hundred and fi y four the people of Ater of Hezekiah ninety eight the people of Bezai three hundred and twenty three the people of Jorah one hundred and twelve the people of Hashum two hundred and twenty three the people of Gibbar ninety five the people of Bethlehem one hundred and twenty three the men of Netophah fi y six the men of Anathoth one hundred and twenty eight the people of Azmaveth forty two the people of Kirjath Arim Chephirah and Beeroth seven hundred and forty three the people of Ramah and Geba six hundred and twenty one the men of Michmas one hundred and twenty two the men of Bethel and Ai two hundred and twenty three the people of Nebo fi y two the people of Magbish one hundred and fi y six the people of the other Elam one thousand two hundred and fi y four the people of Harim three hundred and twenty the people of Lod Hadid and Ono seven hundred and twenty five the people of Jericho three hundred and forty five the people of Senaah three thousand six hundred and thirty
The priests the sons of Jedaiah of the house of Jeshua nine hundred and seventy three the sons of Immer one thousand and fi y two the sons of Pashhur one thousand two hundred and forty seven the sons of Harim one thousand and seventeen
The Levites the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel of the sons of Hodaviah seventy four
The singers the sons of Asaph one hundred and twenty eight
The sons of the gatekeepers the sons of Shallum the sons of Ater the sons of Talmon the sons of Akkub the sons of Ha ta and the sons of Shobai one hundred and thirty nine in all
The Nethinim the sons of Ziha the sons of Hasupha the sons of Tabbaoth the sons of Keros the sons of Siaha the sons of Padon the sons of Lebanah the sons of Hagabah the sons of Akkub the sons of Hagab the sons of Shalmai the sons of Hanan the sons of Giddel the sons of Gahar the sons of Reaiah the sons of Rezin the sons of Nekoda the sons of Gazzam the sons of Uzza the sons of Paseah the sons of Besai the sons of Asnah the sons of Meunim the sons of Nephusim the sons of Bakbuk the sons of Hakupha the sons of Harhur the sons of Bazluth the sons of Mehida the sons of Harsha the sons of Barkos the sons of Sisera the sons of Tamah the sons of Neziah and the sons of Ha pha
The sons of Solomon s servants the sons of Sotai the sons of Sophereth the sons of Peruda the sons of Jaala the sons of Darkon the sons of Giddel the sons of Shepha ah the sons of Ha l the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim and the sons of Ami
All the Nethinim and the children of Solomon s servants were three hundred and ninety two
And these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah Tel Harsha Cherub Addan and Immer but they could not iden fy their father s house or their genealogy whether they were of Israel the sons of Delaiah the sons of Tobiah and the sons of Nekoda six hundred and fi y two and of the sons of the priests the sons of Habaiah the sons of Koz and the sons of Barzillai who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name
These sought their lis ng among those who were registered by genealogy but they were not found therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled
And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things ll a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim
The whole assembly together was forty two thousand three hundred and sixty besides their male and female servants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven and they had two hundred men and women singers
Their horses were seven hundred and thirty six their mules two hundred and forty five their camels four hundred and thirty five and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty
Some of the heads of the fathers houses when they came to the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem offered freely for the house of God to erect it in its place According to their ability they gave to the treasury for the work sixty one thousand gold drachmas five thousand minas of silver and one hundred priestly garments
So the priests and the Levites some of the people the singers the gatekeepers and the Nethinim dwelt in their ci es and all Israel in their ci es
And when the seventh month had come and the children of Israel were in the ci es the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem
Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Sheal el and his brethren arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it as it is wri en in the Law of Moses the man of God
Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those countries they set the altar on its bases and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD both the morning and evening burnt offerings
They also kept the Feast of Tabernacles as it is wri en and offered the daily burnt offerings in the number required by ordinance for each day
A erwards they offered the regular burnt offering and those for New Moons and for all the appointed feasts of the LORD that were consecrated and those of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD
From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD although the founda on of the temple of the LORD had not been laid
They also gave money to the masons and the carpenters and food drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea to Joppa according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia
Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem Zerubbabel the son of Sheal el Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites and all those who had come out of the cap vity to Jerusalem began work and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of the LORD
Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers Kadmiel with his sons and the sons of Judah arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the Levites
When the builders laid the founda on of the temple of the LORD the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals to praise the LORD according to the ordinance of David king of Israel
And they sang responsively praising and giving thanks to the LORD For He is good For His mercy endures forever toward Israel
Then all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the founda on of the house of the LORD was laid
But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers houses old men who had seen the first temple wept with a loud voice when the founda on of this temple was laid before their eyes
Yet many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the sound was heard afar off
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the descendants of the cap vity were building the temple of the LORD God of Israel they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers houses and said to them Let us build with you for we seek your God as you do and we have sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria who brought us here
But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers houses of Israel said to them You may do nothing with us to build a house for our God but we alone will build to the LORD God of Israel as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us
Then the people of the land tried to discourage the people of Judah
They troubled them in building and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia even un l the reign of Darius king of Persia
In the reign of Ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign they wrote an accusa on against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem
In the days of Artaxerxes also Bishlam Mithredath Tabel and the rest of their companions wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia and the le er was wri en in Aramaic script and translated into the Aramaic language
Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a le er against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes in this fashion From Rehum the commander Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions representa ves of the Dinaites the Apharsathchites the Tarpelites the people of Persia and Erech and Babylon and Shushan the Dehavites the Elamites and the rest of the na ons whom the great and noble Osnapper took cap ve and se led in the ci es of Samaria and the remainder beyond the River and so forth
This is a copy of the le er that they sent him To King Artaxerxes from your servants the men of the region beyond the River and so forth Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem and are building the rebellious and evil city and are finishing its walls and repairing the founda ons
Let it now be known to the king that if this city is built and the walls completed they will not pay tax tribute or custom and the king s treasury will be diminished
Now because we receive support from the palace it was not proper for us to see the king s dishonor therefore we have sent and informed the king that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers
And you will find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city harmful to kings and provinces and that they have incited sedi on within the city in former mes for which cause this city was destroyed
We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed the result will be that you will have no dominion beyond the River
The king sent an answer To Rehum the commander to Shimshai the scribe to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria and to the remainder beyond the River Peace and so forth
The le er which you sent to us has been clearly read before me
And I gave the command and a search has been made and it was found that this city in former mes has revolted against kings and rebellion and sedi on have been fostered in it
There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem who have ruled over all the region beyond the River and tax tribute and custom were paid to them
Now give the command to make these men cease that this city may not be built un l the command is given by me
Take heed now that you do not fail to do this
Why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes le er was read before Rehum Shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to Jerusalem against the Jews and by force of arms made them cease
Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased and it was discon nued un l the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia
Then the prophet Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo prophets prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them
So Zerubbabel the son of Sheal el and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem and the prophets of God were with them helping them
At the same me Ta enai the governor of the region beyond the River and Shethar Boznai and their companions came to them and spoke thus to them Who has commanded you to build this temple and finish this wall Then accordingly we told them the names of the men who were construc ng this building
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews so that they could not make them cease ll a report could go to Darius
Then a wri en answer was returned concerning this ma er
This is a copy of the le er that Ta enai sent The governor of the region beyond the River and Shethar Boznai and his companions the Persians who were in the region beyond the River to Darius the king
They sent a le er to him in which was wri en thus To Darius the king All peace
Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea to the temple of the great God which is being built with heavy stones and mber is being laid in the walls and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands
Then we asked those elders and spoke thus to them Who commanded you to build this temple and to finish these walls We also asked them their names to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were chief among them
And thus they returned us an answer saying We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago which a great king of Israel built and completed
But because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the Chaldean who destroyed this temple and carried the people away to Babylon
However in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon King Cyrus issued a decree to build this house of God
Also the gold and silver ar cles of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar whom he had made governor
And he said to him Take these ar cles go carry them to the temple site that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site
Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the founda on of the house of God which is in Jerusalem but from that me even un l now it has been under construc on and it is not finished
Now therefore if it seems good to the king let a search be made in the king s treasure house which is there in Babylon whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this ma er
Then King Darius issued a decree and a search was made in the archives where the treasures were stored in Babylon
And at Achmetha in the palace that is in the province of Media a scroll was found and in it a record was wri en thus In the first year of King Cyrus King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem Let the house be rebuilt the place where they offered sacrifices and let the founda ons of it be firmly laid its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits with three rows of heavy stones and one row of new mber
Let the expenses be paid from the king s treasury
Also let the gold and silver ar cles of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be restored and taken back to the temple which is in Jerusalem each to its place and deposit them in the house of God Now therefore Ta enai governor of the region beyond the River and Shethar Boznai and your companions the Persians who are beyond the River keep yourselves far from there
Let the work of this house of God alone let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site
Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God Let the cost be paid at the king s expense from taxes on the region beyond the River this is to be given immediately to these men so that they are not hindered
And whatever they need young bulls rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons
Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict let a mber be pulled from his house and erected and let him be hanged on it and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this
And may the God who causes His name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem
I Darius issue a decree let it be done diligently
Then Ta enai governor of the region beyond the River Shethar Boznai and their companions diligently did according to what King Darius had sent
So the elders of the Jews built and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo
And they built and finished it according to the commandment of the God of Israel and according to the command of Cyrus Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia
Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius
Then the children of Israel the priests and the Levites and the rest of the descendants of the cap vity celebrated the dedica on of this house of God with joy
And they offered sacrifices at the dedica on of this house of God one hundred bulls two hundred rams four hundred lambs and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats according to the number of the tribes of Israel
They assigned the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their divisions over the service of God in Jerusalem as it is wri en in the Book of Moses
And the descendants of the cap vity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves all of them were ritually clean
And they slaughtered the Passover lambs for all the descendants of the cap vity for their brethren the priests and for themselves
Then the children of Israel who had returned from the cap vity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the filth of the na ons of the land in order to seek the LORD God of Israel
And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy for the LORD made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God the God of Israel
Now a er these things in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia Ezra the son of Seraiah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah the son of Shallum the son of Zadok the son of Ahitub the son of Amariah the son of Azariah the son of Meraioth the son of Zerahiah the son of Uzzi the son of Bukki the son of Abishua the son of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief priest this Ezra came up from Babylon and he was a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses which the LORD God of Israel had given
The king granted him all his request according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him
Some of the children of Israel the priests the Levites the singers the gatekeepers and the Nethinim came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes
And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fi h month which was in the seventh year of the king
On the first day of the first month he began his journey from Babylon and on the first day of the fi h month he came to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon him
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the LORD and to do it and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel
This is a copy of the le er that King Artaxerxes gave Ezra the priest the scribe expert in the words of the commandments of the LORD and of His statutes to Israel Artaxerxes king of kings To Ezra the priest a scribe of the Law of the God of heaven Perfect peace and so forth
I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem may go with you
And whereas you are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand and whereas you are to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem and whereas all the silver and gold that you may find in all the province of Babylon along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests are to be freely offered for the house of their God in Jerusalem now therefore be careful to buy with this money bulls rams and lambs with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem
And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold do it according to the will of your God
Also the ar cles that are given to you for the service of the house of your God deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem
And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God which you may have occasion to provide pay for it from the king s treasury
And I even I Artaxerxes the king issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the region beyond the River that whatever Ezra the priest the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven may require of you let it be done diligently up to one hundred talents of silver one hundred kors of wheat one hundred baths of wine one hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribed limit
Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven let it diligently be done for the house of the God of heaven
For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax tribute or custom on any of the priests Levites singers gatekeepers Nethinim or servants of this house of God
And you Ezra according to your God given wisdom set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are in the region beyond the River all such as know the laws of your God and teach those who do not know them
Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king let judgment be executed speedily on him whether it be death or banishment or confisca on of goods or imprisonment
Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers who has put such a thing as this in the king s heart to beau fy the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king s mighty princes
So I was encouraged as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me
These are the heads of their fathers houses and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes of the sons of Phinehas Gershom of the sons of Ithamar Daniel of the sons of David Ha ush of the sons of Shecaniah of the sons of Parosh Zechariah and registered with him were one hundred and fi y males of the sons of Pahath Moab Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and with him two hundred males of the sons of Shechaniah Ben Jahaziel and with him three hundred males of the sons of Adin Ebed the son of Jonathan and with him fi y males of the sons of Elam Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and with him seventy males of the sons of Shepha ah Zebadiah the son of Michael and with him eighty males of the sons of Joab Obadiah the son of Jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males of the sons of Shelomith Ben Josiphiah and with him one hundred and sixty males of the sons of Bebai Zechariah the son of Bebai and with him twenty eight males of the sons of Azgad Johanan the son of Hakkatan and with him one hundred and ten males of the last sons of Adonikam whose names are these Eliphelet Jeiel and Shemaiah and with them sixty males also of the sons of Bigvai Uthai and Zabbud and with them seventy males
Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava and we camped there three days
And I looked among the people and the priests and found none of the sons of Levi there
Then I sent for Eliezer Ariel Shemaiah Elnathan Jarib Elnathan Nathan Zechariah and Meshullam leaders also for Joiarib and Elnathan men of understanding
And I gave them a command for Iddo the chief man at the place Casiphia and I told them what they should say to Iddo and his brethren the Nethinim at the place Casiphia that they should bring us servants for the house of our God
Then by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi the son of Israel namely Sherebiah with his sons and brothers eighteen men and Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari his brothers and their sons twenty men also of the Nethinim whom David and the leaders had appointed for the service of the Levites two hundred and twenty Nethinim
All of them were designated by name
Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him the right way for us and our li le ones and all our possessions
For I was ashamed to request of the king an escort of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the road because we had spoken to the king saying The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him
So we fasted and entreated our God for this and He answered our prayer
And I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests Sherebiah Hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them and weighed out to them the silver the gold and the ar cles the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel who were present had offered
I weighed into their hand six hundred and fi y talents of silver silver ar cles weighing one hundred talents one hundred talents of gold twenty gold basins worth a thousand drachmas and two vessels of fine polished bronze precious as gold
And I said to them You are holy to the LORD the ar cles are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers
Watch and keep them un l you weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Levites and heads of the fathers houses of Israel in Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the LORD
So the priests and the Levites received the silver and the gold and the ar cles by weight to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twel h day of the first month to go to Jerusalem
And the hand of our God was upon us and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road
So we came to Jerusalem and stayed there three days
Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the ar cles were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas with them were the Levites Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui with the number and weight of everything
All the weight was wri en down at that me
The children of those who had been carried away cap ve who had come from the cap vity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel twelve bulls for all Israel ninety six rams seventy seven lambs and twelve male goats as a sin offering
All this was a burnt offering to the LORD
And they delivered the king s orders to the king s satraps and the governors in the region beyond the River
So they gave support to the people and the house of God
When these things were done the leaders came to me saying The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with respect to the abomina ons of the Canaanites the Hi tes the Perizzites the Jebusites the Ammonites the Moabites the Egyp ans and the Amorites
For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons so that the holy seed is mixed with the peoples of those lands
Indeed the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this trespass
So when I heard this thing I tore my garment and my robe and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard and sat down astonished
Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel assembled to me because of the transgression of those who had been carried away cap ve and I sat astonished un l the evening sacrifice
At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fas ng and having torn my garment and my robe I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God
And I said O my God I am too ashamed and humiliated to li up my face to You my God for our iniqui es have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has grown up to the heavens
Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been very guilty and for our iniqui es we our kings and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to cap vity to plunder and to humilia on as it is this day
And now for a li le while grace has been shown from the LORD our God to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a peg in His holy place that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a measure of revival in our bondage
For we were slaves
Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia to revive us to repair the house of our God to rebuild its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem
And now O our God what shall we say a er this For we have forsaken Your commandments which You commanded by Your servants the prophets saying The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands with their abomina ons which have filled it from one end to another with their impurity
Now therefore do not give your daughters as wives for their sons nor take their daughters to your sons and never seek their peace or prosperity that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever
And a er all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt since You our God have punished us less than our iniqui es deserve and have given us such deliverance as this should we again break Your commandments and join in marriage with the people commi ng these abomina ons Would You not be angry with us un l You had consumed us so that there would be no remnant or survivor O LORD God of Israel You are righteous for we are le as a remnant as it is this day
Here we are before You in our guilt though no one can stand before You because of this Now while Ezra was praying and while he was confessing weeping and bowing down before the house of God a very large assembly of men women and children gathered to him from Israel for the people wept very bi erly
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel one of the sons of Elam spoke up and said to Ezra We have trespassed against our God and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this
Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and those who have been born to them according to the advice of my master and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God and let it be done according to the law
Arise for this ma er is your responsibility
We also are with you
Be of good courage and do it
Then Ezra arose and made the leaders of the priests the Levites and all Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this word
So they swore an oath
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib and when he came there he ate no bread and drank no water for he mourned because of the guilt of those from the cap vity
And they issued a proclama on throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the descendants of the cap vity that they must gather at Jerusalem and that whoever would not come within three days according to the instruc ons of the leaders and elders all his property would be confiscated and he himself would be separated from the assembly of those from the cap vity
So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days
It was the ninth month on the twen eth of the month and all the people sat in the open square of the house of God trembling because of this ma er and because of heavy rain
Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them You have transgressed and have taken pagan wives adding to the guilt of Israel
Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers and do His will separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the pagan wives
Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice Yes As you have said so we must do
But there are many people it is the season for heavy rain and we are not able to stand outside
Nor is this the work of one or two days for there are many of us who have transgressed in this ma er
Please let the leaders of our en re assembly stand and let all those in our ci es who have taken pagan wives come at appointed mes together with the elders and judges of their ci es un l the fierce wrath of our God is turned away from us in this ma er
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite gave them support
Then the descendants of the cap vity did so
And Ezra the priest with certain heads of the fathers households were set apart by the fathers households each of them by name and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the ma er
By the first day of the first month they finished ques oning all the men who had taken pagan wives
And among the sons of the priests who had taken pagan wives the following were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers Maaseiah Eliezer Jarib and Gedaliah
And they gave their promise that they would put away their wives and being guilty they presented a ram of the flock as their trespass offering
Also of the sons of Immer Hanani and Zebadiah of the sons of Harim Maaseiah Elijah Shemaiah Jehiel and Uzziah of the sons of Pashhur Elioenai Maaseiah Ishmael Nethanel Jozabad and Elasah
Also of the Levites Jozabad Shimei Kelaiah the same is Kelita Pethahiah Judah and Eliezer
Also of the singers Eliashib and of the gatekeepers Shallum Telem and Uri
And others of Israel of the sons of Parosh Ramiah Jeziah Malchiah Mijamin Eleazar Malchijah and Benaiah of the sons of Elam Ma aniah Zechariah Jehiel Abdi Jeremoth and Eliah of the sons of Za u Elioenai Eliashib Ma aniah Jeremoth Zabad and Aziza of the sons of Bebai Jehohanan Hananiah Zabbai and Athlai of the sons of Bani Meshullam Malluch Adaiah Jashub Sheal and Ramoth of the sons of Pahath Moab Adna Chelal Benaiah Maaseiah Ma aniah Bezalel Binnui and Manasseh of the sons of Harim Eliezer Ishijah Malchijah Shemaiah Shimeon Benjamin Malluch and Shemariah of the sons of Hashum Ma enai Ma a ah Zabad Eliphelet Jeremai Manasseh and Shimei of the sons of Bani Maadai Amram Uel Benaiah Bedeiah Cheluh Vaniah Meremoth Eliashib Ma aniah Ma enai Jaasai Bani Binnui Shimei Shelemiah Nathan Adaiah Machnadebai Shashai Sharai Azarel Shelemiah Shemariah Shallum Amariah and Joseph of the sons of Nebo Jeiel Ma thiah Zabad Zebina Jaddai Joel and Benaiah
All these had taken pagan wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children
Nehemiah The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah
It came to pass in the month of Chislev in the twen eth year as I was in Shushan the citadel that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped who had survived the cap vity and concerning Jerusalem
And they said to me The survivors who are le from the cap vity in the province are there in great distress and reproach
The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down and its gates are burned with fire
So it was when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned for many days I was fas ng and praying before the God of heaven
And I said I pray LORD God of heaven O great and awesome God You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments please let Your ear be a en ve and Your eyes open that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now day and night for the children of Israel Your servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You
Both my father s house and I have sinned
We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments the statutes nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses
Remember I pray the word that You commanded Your servant Moses saying If you are unfaithful I will sca er you among the na ons but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens yet I will gather them from there and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name
Now these are Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand
O Lord I pray please let Your ear be a en ve to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name and let Your servant prosper this day I pray and grant him mercy in the sight of this man
For I was the king s cupbearer
And it came to pass in the month of Nisan in the twen eth year of King Artaxerxes when wine was before him that I took the wine and gave it to the king
Now I had never been sad in his presence before
Therefore the king said to me Why is your face sad since you are not sick This is nothing but sorrow of heart
So I became dreadfully afraid and said to the king May the king live forever Why should my face not be sad when the city the place of my fathers tombs lies waste and its gates are burned with fire Then the king said to me What do you request So I prayed to the God of heaven
And I said to the king If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight I ask that you send me to Judah to the city of my fathers tombs that I may rebuild it
Then the king said to me the queen also si ng beside him How long will your journey be And when will you return So it pleased the king to send me and I set him a me
Furthermore I said to the king If it pleases the king let le ers be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the River that they must permit me to pass through ll I come to Judah and a le er to Asaph the keeper of the king s forest that he must give me mber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which pertains to the temple for the city wall and for the house that I will occupy
And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me
Then I went to the governors in the region beyond the River and gave them the king s le ers
Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me
When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of it they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well being of the children of Israel
So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days
Then I arose in the night I and a few men with me I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem nor was there any animal with me except the one on which I rode
And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire
Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King s Pool but there was no room for the animal under me to pass
So I went up in the night by the valley and viewed the wall then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate and so returned
And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done I had not yet told the Jews the priests the nobles the officials or the others who did the work
Then I said to them You see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lies waste and its gates are burned with fire
Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer be a reproach
And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me and also of the king s words that he had spoken to me
So they said Let us rise up and build
Then they set their hands to this good work
But when Sanballat the Horonite Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard of it they laughed at us and despised us and said What is this thing that you are doing Will you rebel against the king So I answered them and said to them The God of heaven Himself will prosper us therefore we His servants will arise and build but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem

But it so happened when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall that he was furious and very indignant and mocked the Jews
And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said What are these feeble Jews doing Will they for fy themselves Will they offer sacrifices Will they complete it in a day Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish stones that are burned Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him and he said Whatever they build if even a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall
Hear O our God for we are despised turn their reproach on their own heads and give them as plunder to a land of cap vity Do not cover their iniquity and do not let their sin be blo ed out from before You for they have provoked You to anger before the builders
So we built the wall and the en re wall was joined together up to half its height for the people had a mind to work
Now it happened when Sanballat Tobiah the Arabs the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed that they became very angry and all of them conspired together to come and a ack Jerusalem and create confusion
Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God and because of them we set a watch against them day and night
Then Judah said The strength of the laborers is failing and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall
And our adversaries said They will neither know nor see anything ll we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease
So it was when the Jews who dwelt near them came that they told us ten mes From whatever place you turn they will be upon us
Therefore I posi oned men behind the lower parts of the wall at the openings and I set the people according to their families with their swords their spears and their bows
And I looked and arose and said to the nobles to the leaders and to the rest of the people Do not be afraid of them
Remember the Lord great and awesome and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives and your houses
And it happened when our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had brought their plot to nothing that all of us returned to the wall everyone to his work
So it was from that me on that half of my servants worked at construc on while the other half held the spears the shields the bows and wore armor and the leaders were behind all the house of Judah
Those who built on the wall and those who carried burdens loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construc on and with the other held a weapon
Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built
And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me
Then I said to the nobles the rulers and the rest of the people The work is great and extensive and we are separated far from one another on the wall
Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet rally to us there
Our God will fight for us
So we labored in the work and half of the men held the spears from daybreak un l the stars appeared
At the same me I also said to the people Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day
So neither I my brethren my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes except that everyone took them off for washing
And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren
For there were those who said We our sons and our daughters are many therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live
There were also some who said We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses that we might buy grain because of the famine
There were also those who said We have borrowed money for the king s tax on our lands and vineyards
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery
It is not in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and vineyards
And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words
A er serious thought I rebuked the nobles and rulers and said to them Each of you is exac ng usury from his brother
So I called a great assembly against them
And I said to them According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the na ons
Now indeed will you even sell your brethren Or should they be sold to us Then they were silenced and found nothing to say
Then I said What you are doing is not good
Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the na ons our enemies I also with my brethren and my servants am lending them money and grain
Please let us stop this usury Restore now to them even this day their lands their vineyards their olive groves and their houses also a hundredth of the money and the grain the new wine and the oil that you have charged them
So they said We will restore it and will require nothing from them we will do as you say
Then I called the priests and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise
Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said So may God shake out each man from his house and from his property who does not perform this promise
Even thus may he be shaken out and emp ed
And all the assembly said Amen and praised the LORD
Then the people did according to this promise
Moreover from the me that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah from the twen eth year un l the thirty second year of King Artaxerxes twelve years neither I nor my brothers ate the governor s provisions
But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver
Yes even their servants bore rule over the people but I did not do so because of the fear of God
Indeed I also con nued the work on this wall and we did not buy any land
All my servants were gathered there for the work
And at my table were one hundred and fi y Jews and rulers besides those who came to us from the na ons around us
Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep
Also fowl were prepared for me and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine
Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor s provisions because the bondage was heavy on this people
Remember me my God for good according to all that I have done for this people
Now it happened when Sanballat Tobiah Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that there were no breaks le in it though at that me I had not hung the doors in the gates that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying Come let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono
But they thought to do me harm
So I sent messengers to them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down
Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you But they sent me this message four mes and I answered them in the same manner
Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before the fi h me with an open le er in his hand
In it was wri en It is reported among the na ons and Geshem says that you and the Jews plan to rebel therefore according to these rumors you are rebuilding the wall that you may be their king
And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem saying There is a king in Judah Now these ma ers will be reported to the king
So come therefore and let us consult together
Then I sent to him saying No such things as you say are being done but you invent them in your own heart
For they all were trying to make us afraid saying Their hands will be weakened in the work and it will not be done
Now therefore O God strengthen my hands
A erward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel who was a secret informer and he said Let us meet together in the house of God within the temple and let us close the doors of the temple for they are coming to kill you indeed at night they will come to kill you
And I said Should such a man as I flee And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life I will not go in Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all but that he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him
For this reason he was hired that I should be afraid and act that way and sin so that they might have cause for an evil report that they might reproach me
My God remember Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid
So the wall was finished on the twenty fi h day of Elul in fi y two days
And it happened when all our enemies heard of it and all the na ons around us saw these things that they were very disheartened in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was done by our God
Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many le ers to Tobiah and the le ers of Tobiah came to them
For many in Judah were pledged to him because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah
Also they reported his good deeds before me and reported my words to him
Tobiah sent le ers to frighten me
Then it was when the wall was built and I had hung the doors when the gatekeepers the singers and the Levites had been appointed that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and Hananiah the leader of the citadel for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many
And I said to them Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened un l the sun is hot and while they stand guard let them shut and bar the doors and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem one at his watch sta on and another in front of his own house
Now the city was large and spacious but the people in it were few and the houses were not rebuilt
Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles the rulers and the people that they might be registered by genealogy
And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return and found wri en in it These are the people of the province who came back from the cap vity of those who had been carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah everyone to his city
Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua Nehemiah Azariah Raamiah Nahamani Mordecai Bilshan Mispereth Bigvai Nehum and Baanah
The number of the men of the people of Israel the sons of Parosh two thousand one hundred and seventy two the sons of Shepha ah three hundred and seventy two the sons of Arah six hundred and fi y two the sons of Pahath Moab of the sons of Jeshua and Joab two thousand eight hundred and eighteen the sons of Elam one thousand two hundred and fi y four the sons of Za u eight hundred and forty five the sons of Zaccai seven hundred and sixty the sons of Binnui six hundred and forty eight the sons of Bebai six hundred and twenty eight the sons of Azgad two thousand three hundred and twenty two the sons of Adonikam six hundred and sixty seven the sons of Bigvai two thousand and sixty seven the sons of Adin six hundred and fi y five the sons of Ater of Hezekiah ninety eight the sons of Hashum three hundred and twenty eight the sons of Bezai three hundred and twenty four the sons of Hariph one hundred and twelve the sons of Gibeon ninety five the men of Bethlehem and Netophah one hundred and eighty eight the men of Anathoth one hundred and twenty eight the men of Beth Azmaveth forty two the men of Kirjath Jearim Chephirah and Beeroth seven hundred and forty three the men of Ramah and Geba six hundred and twenty one the men of Michmas one hundred and twenty two the men of Bethel and Ai one hundred and twenty three the men of the other Nebo fi y two the sons of the other Elam one thousand two hundred and fi y four the sons of Harim three hundred and twenty the sons of Jericho three hundred and forty five the sons of Lod Hadid and Ono seven hundred and twenty one the sons of Senaah three thousand nine hundred and thirty

The sons of Solomon s servants the sons of Sotai the sons of Sophereth the sons of Perida the sons of Jaala the sons of Darkon the sons of Giddel the sons of Shepha ah the sons of Ha l the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim and the sons of Amon
All the Nethinim and the sons of Solomon s servants were three hundred and ninety two
And these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah Tel Harsha Cherub Addon and Immer but they could not iden fy their father s house nor their lineage whether they were of Israel the sons of Delaiah the sons of Tobiah the sons of Nekoda six hundred and forty two and of the priests the sons of Habaiah the sons of Koz the sons of Barzillai who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name
These sought their lis ng among those who were registered by genealogy but it was not found therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled
And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things ll a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim
Altogether the whole assembly was forty two thousand three hundred and sixty besides their male and female servants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven and they had two hundred and forty five men and women singers
Their horses were seven hundred and thirty six their mules two hundred and forty five their camels four hundred and thirty five and donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty
And some of the heads of the fathers houses gave to the work
The governor gave to the treasury one thousand gold drachmas fi y basins and five hundred and thirty priestly garments
Some of the heads of the fathers houses gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand gold drachmas and two thousand two hundred silver minas
And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand gold drachmas two thousand silver minas and sixty seven priestly garments
So the priests the Levites the gatekeepers the singers some of the people the Nethinim and all Israel dwelt in their ci es
When the seventh month came the children of Israel were in their ci es
Now all the people gathered together as one man in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate and they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which the LORD had commanded Israel
So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who could hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month
Then he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning un l midday before the men and women and those who could understand and the ears of all the people were a en ve to the Book of the Law
So Ezra the scribe stood on a pla orm of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him at his right hand stood Ma thiah Shema Anaiah Urijah Hilkiah and Maaseiah and at his le hand Pedaiah Mishael Malchijah Hashum Hashbadana Zechariah and Meshullam
And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up
And Ezra blessed the LORD the great God
Then all the people answered Amen Amen while li ing up their hands
And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground
Also Jeshua Bani Sherebiah Jamin Akkub Shabbethai Hodijah Maaseiah Kelita Azariah Jozabad Hanan Pelaiah and the Levites helped the people to understand the Law and the people stood in their place
So they read dis nctly from the book in the Law of God and they gave the sense and helped them to understand the reading
And Nehemiah who was the governor Ezra the priest and scribe and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people This day is holy to the LORD your God do not mourn nor weep
For all the people wept when they heard the words of the Law
Then he said to them Go your way eat the fat drink the sweet and send por ons to those for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy to our LORD
Do not sorrow for the joy of the LORD is your strength
So the Levites quieted all the people saying Be s ll for the day is holy do not be grieved
And all the people went their way to eat and drink to send por ons and rejoice greatly because they understood the words that were declared to them
Now on the second day the heads of the fathers houses of all the people with the priests and Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe in order to understand the words of the Law
And they found wri en in the Law which the LORD had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month and that they should announce and proclaim in all their ci es and in Jerusalem saying Go out to the mountain and bring olive branches branches of oil trees myrtle branches palm branches and branches of leafy trees to make booths as it is wri en
Then the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths each one on the roof of his house or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim
So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the cap vity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun un l that day the children of Israel had not done so
And there was very great gladness
Also day by day from the first day un l the last day he read from the Book of the Law of God
And they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day there was a sacred assembly according to the prescribed manner
Now on the twenty fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fas ng in sackcloth and with dust on their heads
Then those of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniqui es of their fathers
And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for one fourth of the day and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God
Then Jeshua Bani Kadmiel Shebaniah Bunni Sherebiah Bani and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the LORD their God
And the Levites Jeshua Kadmiel Bani Hashabniah Sherebiah Hodijah Shebaniah and Pethahiah said Stand up and bless the LORD your God Forever and ever Blessed be Your glorious name Which is exalted above all blessing and praise You alone are the LORD You have made heaven The heaven of heavens with all their host The earth and everything on it The seas and all that is in them And You preserve them all
The host of heaven worships You
You are the LORD God Who chose Abram And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans And gave him the name Abraham You found his heart faithful before You And made a covenant with him To give the land of the Canaanites The Hi tes the Amorites The Perizzites the Jebusites And the Girgashites To give it to his descendants
You have performed Your words For You are righteous
You saw the afflic on of our fathers in Egypt And heard their cry by the Red Sea
You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh Against all his servants And against all the people of his land
For You knew that they acted proudly against them
So You made a name for Yourself as it is this day
And You divided the sea before them So that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land And their persecutors You threw into the deep As a stone into the mighty waters
Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar And by night with a pillar of fire To give them light on the road Which they should travel
You came down also on Mount Sinai And spoke with them from heaven And gave them just ordinances and true laws Good statutes and commandments
You made known to them Your holy Sabbath And commanded them precepts statutes and laws By the hand of Moses Your servant
You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger And brought them water out of the rock for their thirst And told them to go in to possess the land Which You had sworn to give them
But they and our fathers acted proudly Hardened their necks And did not heed Your commandments
They refused to obey And they were not mindful of Your wonders That You did among them
But they hardened their necks And in their rebellion They appointed a leader To return to their bondage
But You are God Ready to pardon Gracious and merciful Slow to anger Abundant in kindness And did not forsake them
Even when they made a molded calf for themselves And said This is your god That brought you up out of Egypt And worked great provoca ons Yet in Your manifold mercies You did not forsake them in the wilderness
The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day To lead them on the road Nor the pillar of fire by night To show them light And the way they should go
You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them And did not withhold Your manna from their mouth And gave them water for their thirst
Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness They lacked nothing Their clothes did not wear out And their feet did not swell
Moreover You gave them kingdoms and na ons And divided them into districts
So they took possession of the land of Sihon The land of the king of Heshbon And the land of Og king of Bashan
You also mul plied their children as the stars of heaven And brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers To go in and possess
So the people went in And possessed the land You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land The Canaanites And gave them into their hands With their kings And the people of the land That they might do with them as they wished
And they took strong ci es and a rich land And possessed houses full of all goods Cisterns already dug vineyards olive groves And fruit trees in abundance
So they ate and were filled and grew fat And delighted themselves in Your great goodness
Nevertheless they were disobedient And rebelled against You Cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets who tes fied against them To turn them to Yourself And they worked great provoca ons
Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies Who oppressed them And in the me of their trouble When they cried to You You heard from heaven And according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them From the hand of their enemies
But a er they had rest They again did evil before You
Therefore You le them in the hand of their enemies So that they had dominion over them Yet when they returned and cried out to You You heard from heaven And many mes You delivered them according to Your mercies And tes fied against them That You might bring them back to Your law
Yet they acted proudly And did not heed Your commandments But sinned against Your judgments Which if a man does he shall live by them
And they shrugged their shoulders S ffened their necks And would not hear
Yet for many years You had pa ence with them And tes fied against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets
Yet they would not listen Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands
Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not u erly consume them nor forsake them For You are God gracious and merciful
Now therefore our God The great the mighty and awesome God Who keeps covenant and mercy Do not let all the trouble seem small before You That has come upon us Our kings and our princes Our priests and our prophets Our fathers and on all Your people From the days of the kings of Assyria un l this day
However You are just in all that has befallen us For You have dealt faithfully But we have done wickedly
Neither our kings nor our princes Our priests nor our fathers Have kept Your law Nor heeded Your commandments and Your tes monies With which You tes fied against them
For they have not served You in their kingdom Or in the many good things that You gave them Or in the large and rich land which You set before them Nor did they turn from their wicked works
Here we are servants today And the land that You gave to our fathers To eat its fruit and its bounty Here we are servants in it And it yields much increase to the kings You have set over us Because of our sins Also they have dominion over our bodies and our ca le At their pleasure And we are in great distress
And because of all this We make a sure covenant and write it Our leaders our Levites and our priests seal it
Now those who placed their seal on the document were Nehemiah the governor the son of Hacaliah and Zedekiah Seraiah Azariah Jeremiah Pashhur Amariah Malchijah Ha ush Shebaniah Malluch Harim Meremoth Obadiah Daniel Ginnethon Baruch Meshullam Abijah Mijamin Maaziah Bilgai and Shemaiah
These were the priests
The Levites Jeshua the son of Azaniah Binnui of the sons of Henadad and Kadmiel
Their brethren Shebaniah Hodijah Kelita Pelaiah Hanan Micha Rehob Hashabiah Zaccur Sherebiah Shebaniah Hodijah Bani and Beninu
The leaders of the people Parosh Pahath Moab Elam Za u Bani Bunni Azgad Bebai Adonijah Bigvai Adin Ater Hezekiah Azzur Hodijah Hashum Bezai Hariph Anathoth Nebai Magpiash Meshullam Hezir Meshezabel Zadok Jaddua Pela ah Hanan Anaiah Hoshea Hananiah Hasshub Hallohesh Pilha Shobek Rehum Hashabnah Maaseiah Ahijah Hanan Anan Malluch Harim and Baanah
Now the rest of the people the priests the Levites the gatekeepers the singers the Nethinim and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God their wives their sons and their daughters everyone who had knowledge and understanding these joined with their brethren their nobles and entered into a curse and an oath to walk in God s Law which was given by Moses the servant of God and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord and His ordinances and His statutes We would not give our daughters as wives to the peoples of the land nor take their daughters for our sons if the peoples of the land brought wares or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day and we would forego the seventh year s produce and the exac ng of every debt
Also we made ordinances for ourselves to exact from ourselves yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God for the showbread for the regular grain offering for the regular burnt offering of the Sabbaths the New Moons and the set feasts for the holy things for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel and all the work of the house of our God
We cast lots among the priests the Levites and the people for bringing the wood offering into the house of our God according to our fathers houses at the appointed mes year by year to burn on the altar of the LORD our God as it is wri en in the Law
And we made ordinances to bring the firs ruits of our ground and the firs ruits of all fruit of all trees year by year to the house of the LORD to bring the firstborn of our sons and our ca le as it is wri en in the Law and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks to the house of our God to the priests who minister in the house of our God to bring the firs ruits of our dough our offerings the fruit from all kinds of trees the new wine and oil to the priests to the storerooms of the house of our God and to bring the thes of our land to the Levites for the Levites should receive the thes in all our farming communi es
And the priest the descendant of Aaron shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive thes and the Levites shall bring up a tenth of the thes to the house of our God to the rooms of the storehouse
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain of the new wine and the oil to the storerooms where the ar cles of the sanctuary are where the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and the singers are and we will not neglect the house of our God
Now the leaders of the people dwelt at Jerusalem the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city and nine tenths were to dwell in other ci es
And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem
These are the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem
But in the ci es of Judah everyone dwelt in his own possession in their ci es Israelites priests Levites Nethinim and descendants of Solomon s servants
Also in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin
The children of Judah Athaiah the son of Uzziah the son of Zechariah the son of Amariah the son of Shepha ah the son of Mahalalel of the children of Perez and Maaseiah the son of Baruch the son of Col Hozeh the son of Hazaiah the son of Adaiah the son of Joiarib the son of Zechariah the son of Shiloni
All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty eight valiant men
And these are the sons of Benjamin Sallu the son of Meshullam the son of Joed the son of Pedaiah the son of Kolaiah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ithiel the son of Jeshaiah and a er him Gabbai and Sallai nine hundred and twenty eight
Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city
Of the priests Jedaiah the son of Joiarib and Jachin Seraiah the son of Hilkiah the son of Meshullam the son of Zadok the son of Meraioth the son of Ahitub was the leader of the house of God
Their brethren who did the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty two and Adaiah the son of Jeroham the son of Pelaliah the son of Amzi the son of Zechariah the son of Pashhur the son of Malchijah and his brethren heads of the fathers houses were two hundred and forty two and Amashai the son of Azarel the son of Ahzai the son of Meshillemoth the son of Immer and their brethren mighty men of valor were one hundred and twenty eight
Their overseer was Zabdiel the son of one of the great men

All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty four
Moreover the gatekeepers Akkub Talmon and their brethren who kept the gates were one hundred and seventy two
And the rest of Israel of the priests and Levites were in all the ci es of Judah everyone in his inheritance
But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel
And Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim
Also the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani the son of Hashabiah the son of Ma aniah the son of Micha of the sons of Asaph the singers in charge of the service of the house of God
For it was the king s command concerning them that a certain por on should be for the singers a quota day by day
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel of the children of Zerah the son of Judah was the king s deputy in all ma ers concerning the people
And as for the villages with their fields some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kirjath Arba and its villages Dibon and its villages Jekabzeel and its villages in Jeshua Moladah Beth Pelet Hazar Shual and Beersheba and its villages in Ziklag and Meconah and its villages in En Rimmon Zorah Jarmuth Zanoah Adullam and their villages in Lachish and its fields in Azekah and its villages
They dwelt from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom
Also the children of Benjamin from Geba dwelt in Michmash Aija and Bethel and their villages in Anathoth Nob Ananiah in Hazor Ramah Gi aim in Hadid Zeboim Neballat in Lod Ono and the Valley of Cra smen
Some of the Judean divisions of Levites were in Benjamin
Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Sheal el and Jeshua Seraiah Jeremiah Ezra Amariah Malluch Ha ush Shechaniah Rehum Meremoth Iddo Ginnethoi Abijah Mijamin Maadiah Bilgah Shemaiah Joiarib Jedaiah Sallu Amok Hilkiah and Jedaiah
These were the heads of the priests and their brethren in the days of Jeshua
Moreover the Levites were Jeshua Binnui Kadmiel Sherebiah Judah and Ma aniah who led the thanksgiving psalms he and his brethren
Also Bakbukiah and Unni their brethren stood across from them in their du es
Jeshua begot Joiakim Joiakim begot Eliashib Eliashib begot Joiada Joiada begot Jonathan and Jonathan begot Jaddua
Now in the days of Joiakim the priests the heads of the fathers houses were of Seraiah Meraiah of Jeremiah Hananiah of Ezra Meshullam of Amariah Jehohanan of Melichu Jonathan of Shebaniah Joseph of Harim Adna of Meraioth Helkai of Iddo Zechariah of Ginnethon Meshullam of Abijah Zichri the son of Minjamin of Moadiah Piltai of Bilgah Shammua of Shemaiah Jehonathan of Joiarib Ma enai of Jedaiah Uzzi of Sallai Kallai of Amok Eber of Hilkiah Hashabiah and of Jedaiah Nethanel
During the reign of Darius the Persian a record was also kept of the Levites and priests who had been heads of their fathers houses in the days of Eliashib Joiada Johanan and Jaddua
The sons of Levi the heads of the fathers houses un l the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib were wri en in the book of the chronicles
And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah Sherebiah and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel with their brothers across from them to praise and give thanks group alterna ng with group according to the command of David the man of God
Ma aniah Bakbukiah Obadiah Meshullam Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates
These lived in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest the scribe
Now at the dedica on of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedica on with gladness both with thanksgivings and singing with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps
And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem from the villages of the Netophathites from the house of Gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem
Then the priests and Levites purified themselves and purified the people the gates and the wall
So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs
One went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse Gate
A er them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah and Azariah Ezra Meshullam Judah Benjamin Shemaiah Jeremiah and some of the priests sons with trumpets Zechariah the son of Jonathan the son of Shemaiah the son of Ma aniah the son of Michaiah the son of Zaccur the son of Asaph and his brethren Shemaiah Azarel Milalai Gilalai Maai Nethanel Judah and Hanani with the musical instruments of David the man of God
Ezra the scribe went before them
By the Fountain Gate in front of them they went up the stairs of the City of David on the stairway of the wall beyond the house of David as far as the Water Gate eastward
The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way and I was behind them with half of the people on the wall going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall and above the Gate of Ephraim above the Old Gate above the Fish Gate the Tower of Hananel the Tower of the Hundred as far as the Sheep Gate and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison
So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God likewise I and the half of the rulers with me and the priests Eliakim Maaseiah Minjamin Michaiah Elioenai Zechariah and Hananiah with trumpets also Maaseiah Shemaiah Eleazar Uzzi Jehohanan Malchijah Elam and Ezer
The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director
Also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for God had made them rejoice with great joy the women and the children also rejoiced so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off
And at the same me some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings the firs ruits and the thes to gather into them from the fields of the ci es the por ons specified by the Law for the priests and Levites for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered
Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purifica on according to the command of David and Solomon his son
For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God
In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the por ons for the singers and the gatekeepers a por on for each day
They also consecrated holy things for the Levites and the Levites consecrated them for the children of Aaron
On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people and in it was found wri en that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water but hired Balaam against them to curse them
However our God turned the curse into a blessing
So it was when they had heard the Law that they separated all the mixed mul tude from Israel
Now before this Eliashib the priest having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God was allied with Tobiah
And he had prepared for him a large room where previously they had stored the grain offerings the frankincense the ar cles the thes of grain the new wine and oil which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers and the offerings for the priests
But during all this I was not in Jerusalem for in the thirty second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king
Then a er certain days I obtained leave from the king and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God
And it grieved me bi erly therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room
Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms and I brought back into them the ar cles of the house of God with the grain offering and the frankincense
I also realized that the por ons for the Levites had not been given them for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field
So I contended with the rulers and said Why is the house of God forsaken And I gathered them together and set them in their place
Then all Judah brought the the of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse
And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe and of the Levites Pedaiah and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur the son of Ma aniah for they were considered faithful and their task was to distribute to their brethren
Remember me O my God concerning this and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for its services In those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath and bringing in sheaves and loading donkeys with wine grapes figs and all kinds of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day
And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions
Men of Tyre dwelt there also who brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah and in Jerusalem
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said to them What evil thing is this that you do by which you profane the Sabbath day Did not your fathers do thus and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath
So it was at the gates of Jerusalem as it began to be dark before the Sabbath that I commanded the gates to be shut and charged that they must not be opened ll a er the Sabbath
Then I posted some of my servants at the gates so that no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day
Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice
Then I warned them and said to them Why do you spend the night around the wall If you do so again I will lay hands on you From that me on they came no more on the Sabbath
And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should go and guard the gates to sanc fy the Sabbath day
Remember me O my God concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod Ammon and Moab
And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod and could not speak the language of Judah but spoke according to the language of one or the other people
So I contended with them and cursed them struck some of them and pulled out their hair and made them swear by God saying You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things Yet among many na ons there was no king like him who was beloved of his God and God made him king over all Israel
Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin
Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was a son in law of Sanballat the Horonite therefore I drove him from me
Remember them O my God because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites
Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan
I also assigned du es to the priests and the Levites each to his service and to bringing the wood offering and the firs ruits at appointed mes
Remember me O my God for good Esther Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus this was the Ahasuerus who reigned over one hundred and twenty seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in Shushan the citadel that in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his officials and servants the powers of Persia and Media the nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent majesty for many days one hundred and eighty days in all
And when these days were completed the king made a feast las ng seven days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel from great to small in the court of the garden of the king s palace
There were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars and the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster turquoise and white and black marble
And they served drinks in golden vessels each vessel being different from the other with royal wine in abundance according to the generosity of the king
In accordance with the law the drinking was not compulsory for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household that they should do according to each man s pleasure
Queen Vash also made a feast for the women in the royal palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus
On the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded Mehuman Biztha Harbona Bigtha Abagtha Zethar and Carcas seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus to bring Queen Vash before the king wearing her royal crown in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials for she was beau ful to behold
But Queen Vash refused to come at the king s command brought by his eunuchs therefore the king was furious and his anger burned within him
Then the king said to the wise men who understood the mes for this was the king s manner toward all who knew law and jus ce those closest to him being Carshena Shethar Admatha Tarshish Meres Marsena and Memucan the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king s presence and who ranked highest in the kingdom What shall we do to Queen Vash according to law because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the eunuchs And Memucan answered before the king and the princes Queen Vash has not only wronged the king but also all the princes and all the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus
For the queen s behavior will become known to all women so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes when they report King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vash to be brought in before him but she did not come
This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen
Thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath
If it pleases the king let a royal decree go out from him and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it will not be altered that Vash shall come no more before King Ahasuerus and let the king give her royal posi on to another who is be er than she
When the king s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire for it is great all wives will honor their husbands both great and small
And the reply pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of Memucan
Then he sent le ers to all the king s provinces to each province in its own script and to every people in their own language that each man should be master in his own house and speak in the language of his own people
A er these things when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided he remembered Vash what she had done and what had been decreed against her
Then the king s servants who a ended him said Let beau ful young virgins be sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather all the beau ful young virgins to Shushan the citadel into the women s quarters under the custody of Hegai the king s eunuch custodian of the women
And let beauty prepara ons be given them
Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vash
This thing pleased the king and he did so
In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish a Benjamite
Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the cap ves who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away
And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncle s daughter for she had neither father nor mother
The young woman was lovely and beau ful
When her father and mother died Mordecai took her as his own daughter
So it was when the king s command and decree were heard and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel under the custody of Hegai that Esther also was taken to the king s palace into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women
Now the young woman pleased him and she obtained his favor so he readily gave beauty prepara ons to her besides her allowance
Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king s palace and he moved her and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women
Esther had not revealed her people or family for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal it
And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women s quarters to learn of Esther s welfare and what was happening to her
Each young woman s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus a er she had completed twelve months prepara on according to the regula ons for the women for thus were the days of their prepara on appor oned six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and prepara ons for beau fying women
Thus prepared each young woman went to the king and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women s quarters to the king s palace
In the evening she went and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women to the custody of Shaashgaz the king s eunuch who kept the concubines
She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name
Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter to go in to the king she requested nothing but what Hegai the king s eunuch the custodian of the women advised
And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her
So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month of Tebeth in the seventh year of his reign
The king loved Esther more than all the other women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vash
Then the king made a great feast the Feast of Esther for all his officials and servants and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gi s according to the generosity of a king
When virgins were gathered together a second me Mordecai sat within the king s gate
Now Esther had not revealed her family and her people just as Mordecai had charged her for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him
In those days while Mordecai sat within the king s gate two of the king s eunuchs Bigthan and Teresh doorkeepers became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus
So the ma er became known to Mordecai who told Queen Esther and Esther informed the king in Mordecai s name
And when an inquiry was made into the ma er it was confirmed and both were hanged on a gallows and it was wri en in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king
A er these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him
And all the king s servants who were within the king s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman for so the king had commanded concerning him
But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage
Then the king s servants who were within the king s gate said to Mordecai Why do you transgress the king s command Now it happened when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them that they told it to Haman to see whether Mordecai s words would stand for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew
When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage Haman was filled with wrath
But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone for they had told him of the people of Mordecai
Instead Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus the people of Mordecai
In the first month which is the month of Nisan in the twel h year of King Ahasuerus they cast Pur that is the lot before Haman to determine the day and the month un l it fell on the twel h month which is the month of Adar
Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus There is a certain people sca ered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom their laws are different from all other people s and they do not keep the king s laws
Therefore it is not fi ng for the king to let them remain
If it pleases the king let a decree be wri en that they be destroyed and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work to bring it into the king s treasuries
So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the enemy of the Jews
And the king said to Haman The money and the people are given to you to do with them as seems good to you
Then the king s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month and a decree was wri en according to all that Haman commanded to the king s satraps to the governors who were over each province to the officials of all people to every province according to its script and to every people in their language
In the name of King Ahasuerus it was wri en and sealed with the king s signet ring
And the le ers were sent by couriers into all the king s provinces to destroy to kill and to annihilate all the Jews both young and old li le children and women in one day on the thirteenth day of the twel h month which is the month of Adar and to plunder their possessions
A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province being published for all people that they should be ready for that day
The couriers went out hastened by the king s command and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel
So the king and Haman sat down to drink but the city of Shushan was perplexed
When Mordecai learned all that had happened he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes and went out into the midst of the city
He cried out with a loud and bi er cry
He went as far as the front of the king s gate for no one might enter the king s gate clothed with sackcloth
And in every province where the king s command and decree arrived there was great mourning among the Jews with fas ng weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes
So Esther s maids and eunuchs came and told her and the queen was deeply distressed
Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him but he would not accept them
Then Esther called Hathach one of the king s eunuchs whom he had appointed to a end her and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai to learn what and why this was
So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king s gate
And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king s treasuries to destroy the Jews
He also gave him a copy of the wri en decree for their destruc on which was given at Shushan that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplica on to him and plead before him for her people
So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai
Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a command for Mordecai All the king s servants and the people of the king s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king who has not been called he has but one law put all to death except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live
Yet I myself have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days
So they told Mordecai Esther s words
And Mordecai told them to answer Esther Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king s palace any more than all the other Jews
For if you remain completely silent at this me relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place but you and your father s house will perish
Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a me as this Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai Go gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan and fast for me neither eat nor drink for three days night or day
My maids and I will fast likewise
And so I will go to the king which is against the law and if I perish I perish So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him
Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king s palace across from the king s house while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house facing the entrance of the house
So it was when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court that she found favor in his sight and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand
Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter
And the king said to her What do you wish Queen Esther What is your request It shall be given to you up to half the kingdom So Esther answered If it pleases the king let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him
Then the king said Bring Haman quickly that he may do as Esther has said
So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared
At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther What is your pe on It shall be granted you
What is your request up to half the kingdom It shall be done Then Esther answered and said My pe on and request is this If I have found favor in the sight of the king and if it pleases the king to grant my pe on and fulfill my request then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them and tomorrow I will do as the king has said
So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king s gate and that he did not stand or tremble before him he was filled with indigna on against Mordecai
Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh
Then Haman told them of his great riches the mul tude of his children everything in which the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king
Moreover Haman said Besides Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared and tomorrow I am again invited by her along with the king
Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai the Jew si ng at the king s gate
Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him Let a gallows be made fi y cubits high and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it then go merrily with the king to the banquet
And the thing pleased Haman so he had the gallows made
That night the king could not sleep
So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles and they were read before the king
And it was found wri en that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh two of the king s eunuchs the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus
Then the king said What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this And the king s servants who a ended him said Nothing has been done for him
So the king said Who is in the court Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him
The king s servants said to him Haman is there standing in the court
And the king said Let him come in
So Haman came in and the king asked him What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor Now Haman thought in his heart Whom would the king delight to honor more than me And Haman answered the king For the man whom the king delights to honor let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn and a horse on which the king has ridden which has a royal crest placed on its head
Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king s most noble princes that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor
Then parade him on horseback through the city square and proclaim before him Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor Then the king said to Haman Hurry take the robe and the horse as you have suggested and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king s gate Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken
So Haman took the robe and the horse arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square and proclaimed before him Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor A erward Mordecai went back to the king s gate
But Haman hurried to his house mourning and with his head covered
When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him If Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is of Jewish descent you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him
While they were s ll talking with him the king s eunuchs came and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared
So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther
And on the second day at the banquet of wine the king again said to Esther What is your pe on Queen Esther It shall be granted you
And what is your request up to half the kingdom It shall be done Then Queen Esther answered and said If I have found favor in your sight O king and if it pleases the king let my life be given me at my pe on and my people at my request
For we have been sold my people and I to be destroyed to be killed and to be annihilated
Had we been sold as male and female slaves I would have held my tongue although the enemy could never compensate for the king s loss
So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther Who is he and where is he who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing And Esther said The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman So Haman was terrified before the king and queen
Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden but Haman stood before Queen Esther pleading for his life for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king
When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther was
Then the king said Will he also assault the queen while I am in the house As the word le the king s mouth they covered Haman s face
Now Harbonah one of the eunuchs said to the king Look The gallows fi y cubits high which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good on the king s behalf is standing at the house of Haman
Then the king said Hang him on it So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai
Then the king s wrath subsided
On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman the enemy of the Jews
And Mordecai came before the king for Esther had told how he was related to her
So the king took off his signet ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it to Mordecai and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman
Now Esther spoke again to the king fell down at his feet and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews
And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther
So Esther arose and stood before the king and said If it pleases the king and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes let it be wri en to revoke the le ers devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king s provinces
For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people Or how can I endure to see the destruc on of my countrymen Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew Indeed I have given Esther the house of Haman and they have hanged him on the gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews
You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews as you please in the king s name and seal it with the king s signet ring for whatever is wri en in the king s name and sealed with the king s signet ring no one can revoke
So the king s scribes were called at that me in the third month which is the month of Sivan on the twenty third day and it was wri en according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews the satraps the governors and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia one hundred and twenty seven provinces in all to every province in its own script to every people in their own language and to the Jews in their own script and language
And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus sealed it with the king s signet ring and sent le ers by couriers on horseback riding on royal horses bred from swi steeds
By these le ers the king permi ed the Jews who were in every city to gather together and protect their lives to destroy kill and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them both li le children and women and to plunder their possessions on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on the thirteenth day of the twel h month which is the month of Adar
A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies
The couriers who rode on royal horses went out hastened and pressed on by the king s command
And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel
So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad
The Jews had light and gladness joy and honor
And in every province and city wherever the king s command and decree came the Jews had joy and gladness a feast and a holiday
Then many of the people of the land became Jews because fear of the Jews fell upon them
Now in the twel h month that is the month of Adar on the thirteenth day the me came for the king s command and his decree to be executed
On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them the opposite occurred in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them
The Jews gathered together in their ci es throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm
And no one could withstand them because fear of them fell upon all people
And all the officials of the provinces the satraps the governors and all those doing the king s work helped the Jews because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them
For Mordecai was great in the king s palace and his fame spread throughout all the provinces for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent
Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword with slaughter and destruc on and did what they pleased with those who hated them
And in Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men
Also Parshandatha Dalphon Aspatha Poratha Adalia Aridatha Parmashta Arisai Aridai and Vajezatha the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the enemy of the Jews they killed but they did not lay a hand on the plunder
On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel was brought to the king
And the king said to Queen Esther The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel and the ten sons of Haman
What have they done in the rest of the king s provinces Now what is your pe on It shall be granted to you
Or what is your further request It shall be done
Then Esther said If it pleases the king let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today s decree and let Haman s ten sons be hanged on the gallows
So the king commanded this to be done the decree was issued in Shushan and they hanged Haman s ten sons
And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan but they did not lay a hand on the plunder
The remainder of the Jews in the king s provinces gathered together and protected their lives had rest from their enemies and killed seventy five thousand of their enemies but they did not lay a hand on the plunder
This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar
And on the fourteenth day of the month they rested and made it a day of feas ng and gladness
But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day as well as on the fourteenth and on the fi eenth of the month they rested and made it a day of feas ng and gladness
Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar with gladness and feas ng as a holiday and for sending presents to one another
And Mordecai wrote these things and sent le ers to all the Jews near and far who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fi eenth days of the month of Adar as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them and from mourning to a holiday that they should make them days of feas ng and joy of sending presents to one another and gi s to the poor
So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun as Mordecai had wri en to them because Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the enemy of all the Jews had plo ed against the Jews to annihilate them and had cast Pur that is the lot to consume them and destroy them but when Esther came before the king he commanded by le er that this wicked plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows
So they called these days Purim a er the name Pur
Therefore because of all the words of this le er what they had seen concerning this ma er and what had happened to them the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year according to the wri en instruc ons and according to the prescribed me that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every genera on every family every province and every city that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews and that the memory of them should not perish among their descendants
Then Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail with Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second le er about Purim
And Mordecai sent le ers to all the Jews to the one hundred and twenty seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus with words of peace and truth to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed me as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning ma ers of their fas ng and lamen ng
So the decree of Esther confirmed these ma ers of Purim and it was wri en in the book
And King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea
Now all the acts of his power and his might and the account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him are they not wri en in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus and was great among the Jews and well received by the mul tude of his brethren seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his countrymen
Job There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job and that man was blameless and upright and one who feared God and shunned evil
And seven sons and three daughters were born to him
Also his possessions were seven thousand sheep three thousand camels five hundred yoke of oxen five hundred female donkeys and a very large household so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East
And his sons would go and feast in their houses each on his appointed day and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them
So it was when the days of feas ng had run their course that Job would send and sanc fy them and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all
For Job said It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts
Thus Job did regularly
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan also came among them
And the LORD said to Satan From where do you come So Satan answered the LORD and said From going to and fro on the earth and from walking back and forth on it
Then the LORD said to Satan Have you considered My servant Job that there is none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man one who fears God and shuns evil So Satan answered the LORD and said Does Job fear God for nothing Have You not made a hedge around him around his household and around all that he has on every side You have blessed the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land
But now stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has and he will surely curse You to Your face And the LORD said to Satan Behold all that he has is in your power only do not lay a hand on his person
So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD
Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were ea ng and drinking wine in their oldest brother s house and a messenger came to Job and said The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them when the Sabeans raided them and took them away indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword and I alone have escaped to tell you While he was s ll speaking another also came and said The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I alone have escaped to tell you While he was s ll speaking another also came and said The Chaldeans formed three bands raided the camels and took them away yes and killed the servants with the edge of the sword and I alone have escaped to tell you While he was s ll speaking another also came and said Your sons and daughters were ea ng and drinking wine in their oldest brother s house and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house and it fell on the young people and they are dead and I alone have escaped to tell you Then Job arose tore his robe and shaved his head and he fell to the ground and worshiped
And he said Naked I came from my mother s womb And naked shall I return there
The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away Blessed be the name of the LORD
In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD
And the LORD said to Satan From where do you come So Satan answered the LORD and said From going to and fro on the earth and from walking back and forth on it
Then the LORD said to Satan Have you considered My servant Job that there is none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man one who fears God and shuns evil And s ll he holds fast to his integrity although you incited Me against him to destroy him without cause
So Satan answered the LORD and said Skin for skin Yes all that a man has he will give for his life
But stretch out Your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will surely curse You to Your face And the LORD said to Satan Behold he is in your hand but spare his life
So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head
And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes
Then his wife said to him Do you s ll hold fast to your integrity Curse God and die But he said to her You speak as one of the foolish women speaks
Shall we indeed accept good from God and shall we not accept adversity In all this Job did not sin with his lips
Now when Job s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him each one came from his own place Eliphaz the Temanite Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite
For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him and to comfort him
And when they raised their eyes from afar and did not recognize him they li ed their voices and wept and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven
So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights and no one spoke a word to him for they saw that his grief was very great
A er this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth
And Job spoke and said May the day perish on which I was born And the night in which it was said A male child is conceived
May that day be darkness May God above not seek it Nor the light shine upon it
May darkness and the shadow of death claim it May a cloud se le on it May the blackness of the day terrify it
As for that night may darkness seize it May it not rejoice among the days of the year May it not come into the number of the months
Oh may that night be barren May no joyful shout come into it May those curse it who curse the day Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan
May the stars of its morning be dark May it look for light but have none And not see the dawning of the day Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother s womb Nor hide sorrow from my eyes
Why did I not die at birth Why did I not perish when I came from the womb Why did the knees receive me Or why the breasts that I should nurse For now I would have lain s ll and been quiet I would have been asleep Then I would have been at rest With kings and counselors of the earth Who built ruins for themselves Or with princes who had gold Who filled their houses with silver Or why was I not hidden like a s llborn child Like infants who never saw light There the wicked cease from troubling And there the weary are at rest
There the prisoners rest together They do not hear the voice of the oppressor
The small and great are there And the servant is free from his master
Why is light given to him who is in misery And life to the bi er of soul Who long for death but it does not come And search for it more than hidden treasures Who rejoice exceedingly And are glad when they can find the grave Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden And whom God has hedged in For my sighing comes before I eat And my groanings pour out like water
For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me And what I dreaded has happened to me
I am not at ease nor am I quiet I have no rest for trouble comes
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said If one a empts a word with you will you become weary But who can withhold himself from speaking Surely you have instructed many And you have strengthened weak hands
Your words have upheld him who was stumbling And you have strengthened the feeble knees But now it comes upon you and you are weary It touches you and you are troubled
Is not your reverence your confidence And the integrity of your ways your hope Remember now who ever perished being innocent Or where were the upright ever cut off Even as I have seen Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same
By the blast of God they perish And by the breath of His anger they are consumed
The roaring of the lion The voice of the fierce lion And the teeth of the young lions are broken
The old lion perishes for lack of prey And the cubs of the lioness are sca ered
Now a word was secretly brought to me And my ear received a whisper of it
In disquie ng thoughts from the visions of the night When deep sleep falls on men Fear came upon me and trembling Which made all my bones shake
Then a spirit passed before my face The hair on my body stood up
It stood s ll But I could not discern its appearance
A form was before my eyes There was silence Then I heard a voice saying Can a mortal be more righteous than God Can a man be more pure than his Maker If He puts no trust in His servants If He charges His angels with error How much more those who dwell in houses of clay Whose founda on is in the dust Who are crushed before a moth They are broken in pieces from morning ll evening They perish forever with no one regarding
Does not their own excellence go away They die even without wisdom
Call out now Is there anyone who will answer you And to which of the holy ones will you turn For wrath kills a foolish man And envy slays a simple one
I have seen the foolish taking root But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place
His sons are far from safety They are crushed in the gate And there is no deliverer
Because the hungry eat up his harvest Taking it even from the thorns And a snare snatches their substance
For afflic on does not come from the dust Nor does trouble spring from the ground Yet man is born to trouble As the sparks fly upward
But as for me I would seek God And to God I would commit my cause Who does great things and unsearchable Marvelous things without number
He gives rain on the earth And sends waters on the fields
He sets on high those who are lowly And those who mourn are li ed to safety
He frustrates the devices of the cra y So that their hands cannot carry out their plans
He catches the wise in their own cra iness And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them
They meet with darkness in the day me And grope at noon me as in the night
But He saves the needy from the sword From the mouth of the mighty And from their hand
So the poor have hope And injus ce shuts her mouth
Behold happy is the man whom God corrects Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty
For He bruises but He binds up He wounds but His hands make whole
He shall deliver you in six troubles Yes in seven no evil shall touch you
In famine He shall redeem you from death And in war from the power of the sword
You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue And you shall not be afraid of destruc on when it comes
You shall laugh at destruc on and famine And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth
For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you
You shall know that your tent is in peace You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss
You shall also know that your descendants shall be many And your offspring like the grass of the earth
You shall come to the grave at a full age As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season
Behold this we have searched out It is true
Hear it and know for yourself
Then Job answered and said Oh that my grief were fully weighed And my calamity laid with it on the scales For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea Therefore my words have been rash
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me My spirit drinks in their poison The terrors of God are arrayed against me
Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass Or does the ox low over its fodder Can flavorless food be eaten without salt Or is there any taste in the white of an egg My soul refuses to touch them They are as loathsome food to me
Oh that I might have my request That God would grant me the thing that I long for That it would please God to crush me That He would loose His hand and cut me off Then I would s ll have comfort Though in anguish I would exult He will not spare For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One
What strength do I have that I should hope And what is my end that I should prolong my life Is my strength the strength of stones Or is my flesh bronze Is my help not within me And is success driven from me To him who is afflicted kindness should be shown by his friend Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty
My brothers have dealt decei ully like a brook Like the streams of the brooks that pass away Which are dark because of the ice And into which the snow vanishes
When it is warm they cease to flow When it is hot they vanish from their place
The paths of their way turn aside They go nowhere and perish
The caravans of Tema look The travelers of Sheba hope for them
They are disappointed because they were confident They come there and are confused
For now you are nothing You see terror and are afraid
Did I ever say Bring something to me Or Offer a bribe for me from your wealth Or Deliver me from the enemy s hand Or Redeem me from the hand of oppressors Teach me and I will hold my tongue Cause me to understand wherein I have erred
How forceful are right words But what does your arguing prove Do you intend to rebuke my words And the speeches of a desperate one which are as wind Yes you overwhelm the fatherless And you undermine your friend
Now therefore be pleased to look at me For I would never lie to your face
Yield now let there be no injus ce Yes concede my righteousness s ll stands Is there injus ce on my tongue Cannot my taste discern the unsavory Is there not a me of hard service for man on earth Are not his days also like the days of a hired man Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages So I have been allo ed months of fu lity And wearisome nights have been appointed to me
When I lie down I say When shall I arise And the night be ended For I have had my fill of tossing ll dawn
My flesh is caked with worms and dust My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh
My days are swi er than a weaver s shu le And are spent without hope
Oh remember that my life is a breath My eye will never again see good
The eye of him who sees me will see me no more While your eyes are upon me I shall no longer be
As the cloud disappears and vanishes away So he who goes down to the grave does not come up
He shall never return to his house Nor shall his place know him anymore
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bi erness of my soul
Am I a sea or a sea serpent That You set a guard over me When I say My bed will comfort me My couch will ease my complaint Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions So that my soul chooses strangling And death rather than my body
I loathe my life I would not live forever
Let me alone For my days are but a breath
What is man that You should exalt him That You should set Your heart on him That You should visit him every morning And test him every moment How long Will You not look away from me And let me alone ll I swallow my saliva Have I sinned What have I done to You O watcher of men Why have You set me as Your target So that I am a burden to myself Why then do You not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity For now I will lie down in the dust And You will seek me diligently But I will no longer be
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said How long will you speak these things And the words of your mouth be like a strong wind Does God subvert judgment Or does the Almighty pervert jus ce If your sons have sinned against Him He has cast them away for their transgression
If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplica on to the Almighty If you were pure and upright Surely now He would awake for you And prosper your righ ul dwelling place
Though your beginning was small Yet your la er end would increase abundantly
For inquire please of the former age And consider the things discovered by their fathers For we were born yesterday and know nothing Because our days on earth are a shadow
Will they not teach you and tell you And u er words from their heart Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh Can the reeds flourish without water While it is yet green and not cut down It withers before any other plant
So are the paths of all who forget God And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish Whose confidence shall be cut off And whose trust is a spider s web
He leans on his house but it does not stand
He holds it fast but it does not endure
He grows green in the sun And his branches spread out in his garden
His roots wrap around the rock heap And look for a place in the stones
If he is destroyed from his place Then it will deny him saying I have not seen you
Behold this is the joy of His way And out of the earth others will grow
Behold God will not cast away the blameless Nor will He uphold the evildoers
He will yet fill your mouth with laughing And your lips with rejoicing
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing
Then Job answered and said Truly I know it is so But how can a man be righteous before God If one wished to contend with Him He could not answer Him one me out of a thousand
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength
Who has hardened himself against Him and prospered He removes the mountains and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger He shakes the earth out of its place And its pillars tremble He commands the sun and it does not rise He seals off the stars He alone spreads out the heavens And treads on the waves of the sea He made the Bear Orion and the Pleiades And the chambers of the south He does great things past finding out Yes wonders without number
If He goes by me I do not see Him If He moves past I do not perceive Him If He takes away who can hinder Him Who can say to Him What are You doing God will not withdraw His anger The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him
How then can I answer Him And choose my words to reason with Him For though I were righteous I could not answer Him I would beg mercy of my Judge
If I called and He answered me I would not believe that He was listening to my voice
For He crushes me with a tempest And mul plies my wounds without cause
He will not allow me to catch my breath But fills me with bi erness
If it is a ma er of strength indeed He is strong And if of jus ce who will appoint my day in court Though I were righteous my own mouth would condemn me Though I were blameless it would prove me perverse
I am blameless yet I do not know myself I despise my life
It is all one thing Therefore I say He destroys the blameless and the wicked
If the scourge slays suddenly He laughs at the plight of the innocent
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked
He covers the faces of its judges
If it is not He who else could it be Now my days are swi er than a runner They flee away they see no good
They pass by like swi ships Like an eagle swooping on its prey
If I say I will forget my complaint I will put off my sad face and wear a smile I am afraid of all my sufferings I know that You will not hold me innocent
If I am condemned Why then do I labor in vain If I wash myself with snow water And cleanse my hands with soap Yet You will plunge me into the pit And my own clothes will abhor me
For He is not a man as I am That I may answer Him And that we should go to court together
Nor is there any mediator between us Who may lay his hand on us both
Let Him take His rod away from me And do not let dread of Him terrify me
Then I would speak and not fear Him But it is not so with me
My soul loathes my life I will give free course to my complaint I will speak in the bi erness of my soul
I will say to God Do not condemn me Show me why You contend with me
Does it seem good to You that You should oppress That You should despise the work of Your hands And smile on the counsel of the wicked Do You have eyes of flesh Or do You see as man sees Are Your days like the days of a mortal man Are Your years like the days of a mighty man That You should seek for my iniquity And search out my sin Although You know that I am not wicked And there is no one who can deliver from Your hand Your hands have made me and fashioned me An intricate unity Yet You would destroy me
Remember I pray that You have made me like clay
And will You turn me into dust again Did you not pour me out like milk And curdle me like cheese Clothe me with skin and flesh And knit me together with bones and sinews You have granted me life and favor And Your care has preserved my spirit
And these things You have hidden in Your heart I know that this was with You If I sin then You mark me And will not acquit me of my iniquity
If I am wicked woe to me Even if I am righteous I cannot li up my head
I am full of disgrace See my misery If my head is exalted You hunt me like a fierce lion And again You show Yourself awesome against me
You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your indigna on toward me Changes and war are ever with me
Why then have You brought me out of the womb Oh that I had perished and no eye had seen me I would have been as though I had not been
I would have been carried from the womb to the grave
Are not my days few Cease Leave me alone that I may take a li le comfort Before I go to the place from which I shall not return To the land of darkness and the shadow of death A land as dark as darkness itself As the shadow of death without any order Where even the light is like darkness
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said Should not the mul tude of words be answered And should a man full of talk be vindicated Should your empty talk make men hold their peace And when you mock should no one rebuke you For you have said My doctrine is pure And I am clean in your eyes
But oh that God would speak And open His lips against you That He would show you the secrets of wisdom For they would double your prudence
Know therefore that God exacts from you Less than your iniquity deserves
Can you search out the deep things of God Can you find out the limits of the Almighty They are higher than heaven what can you do Deeper than Sheol what can you know Their measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea
If He passes by imprisons and gathers to judgment Then who can hinder Him For He knows decei ul men He sees wickedness also
Will He not then consider it For an empty headed man will be wise When a wild donkey s colt is born a man
If you would prepare your heart And stretch out your hands toward Him If iniquity were in your hand and you put it far away And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents Then surely you could li up your face without spot Yes you could be steadfast and not fear Because you would forget your misery And remember it as waters that have passed away And your life would be brighter than noonday
Though you were dark you would be like the morning
And you would be secure because there is hope Yes you would dig around you and take your rest in safety
You would also lie down and no one would make you afraid Yes many would court your favor
But the eyes of the wicked will fail And they shall not escape And their hope loss of life Then Job answered and said No doubt you are the people And wisdom will die with you But I have understanding as well as you I am not inferior to you
Indeed who does not know such things as these I am one mocked by his friends Who called on God and He answered him The just and blameless who is ridiculed
A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease It is made ready for those whose feet slip
The tents of robbers prosper And those who provoke God are secure In what God provides by His hand
But now ask the beasts and they will teach you And the birds of the air and they will tell you Or speak to the earth and it will teach you And the fish of the sea will explain to you
Who among all these does not know That the hand of the LORD has done this In whose hand is the life of every living thing And the breath of all mankind Does not the ear test words And the mouth taste its food Wisdom is with aged men And with length of days understanding
With Him are wisdom and strength He has counsel and understanding
If He breaks a thing down it cannot be rebuilt If He imprisons a man there can be no release
If He withholds the waters they dry up If He sends them out they overwhelm the earth
With Him are strength and prudence
The deceived and the deceiver are His
He leads counselors away plundered And makes fools of the judges
He loosens the bonds of kings And binds their waist with a belt
He leads princes away plundered And overthrows the mighty
He deprives the trusted ones of speech And takes away the discernment of the elders
He pours contempt on princes And disarms the mighty
He uncovers deep things out of darkness And brings the shadow of death to light
He makes na ons great and destroys them He enlarges na ons and guides them
He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness
They grope in the dark without light And He makes them stagger like a drunken man
Behold my eye has seen all this My ear has heard and understood it
What you know I also know I am not inferior to you
But I would speak to the Almighty And I desire to reason with God
But you forgers of lies You are all worthless physicians
Oh that you would be silent And it would be your wisdom Now hear my reasoning And heed the pleadings of my lips
Will you speak wickedly for God And talk decei ully for Him Will you show par ality for Him Will you contend for God Will it be well when He searches you out Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man He will surely rebuke you If you secretly show par ality
Will not His excellence make you afraid And the dread of Him fall upon you Your pla tudes are proverbs of ashes Your defenses are defenses of clay
Hold your peace with me and let me speak Then let come on me what may Why do I take my flesh in my teeth And put my life in my hands Though He slay me yet will I trust Him
Even so I will defend my own ways before Him
He also shall be my salva on For a hypocrite could not come before Him
Listen carefully to my speech And to my declara on with your ears
See now I have prepared my case I know that I shall be vindicated
Who is he who will contend with me If now I hold my tongue I perish
Only two things do not do to me Then I will not hide myself from You Withdraw Your hand far from me And let not the dread of You make me afraid
Then call and I will answer Or let me speak then You respond to me
How many are my iniqui es and sins Make me know my transgression and my sin
Why do You hide Your face And regard me as Your enemy Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro And will You pursue dry stubble For You write bi er things against me And make me inherit the iniqui es of my youth
You put my feet in the stocks And watch closely all my paths
You set a limit for the soles of my feet
Man decays like a ro en thing Like a garment that is moth eaten
Man who is born of woman Is of few days and full of trouble
He comes forth like a flower and fades away He flees like a shadow and does not con nue
And do You open Your eyes on such a one And bring me to judgment with Yourself Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean No one Since his days are determined The number of his months is with You You have appointed his limits so that he cannot pass
Look away from him that he may rest Till like a hired man he finishes his day
For there is hope for a tree If it is cut down that it will sprout again And that its tender shoots will not cease
Though its root may grow old in the earth And its stump may die in the ground Yet at the scent of water it will bud And bring forth branches like a plant
But man dies and is laid away Indeed he breathes his last And where is he As water disappears from the sea And a river becomes parched and dries up So man lies down and does not rise
Till the heavens are no more They will not awake Nor be roused from their sleep
Oh that You would hide me in the grave That You would conceal me un l Your wrath is past That You would appoint me a set me and remember me If a man dies shall he live again All the days of my hard service I will wait Till my change comes
You shall call and I will answer You You shall desire the work of Your hands
For now You number my steps But do not watch over my sin
My transgression is sealed up in a bag And You cover my iniquity
But as a mountain falls and crumbles away And as a rock is moved from its place As water wears away stones And as torrents wash away the soil of the earth So You destroy the hope of man
You prevail forever against him and he passes on You change his countenance and send him away
His sons come to honor and he does not know it They are brought low and he does not perceive it
But his flesh will be in pain over it And his soul will mourn over it
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge And fill himself with the east wind Should he reason with unprofitable talk Or by speeches with which he can do no good Yes you cast off fear And restrain prayer before God
For your iniquity teaches your mouth And you choose the tongue of the cra y
Your own mouth condemns you and not I Yes your own lips tes fy against you
Are you the first man who was born Or were you made before the hills Have you heard the counsel of God Do you limit wisdom to yourself What do you know that we do not know What do you understand that is not in us Both the gray haired and the aged are among us Much older than your father
Are the consola ons of God too small for you And the word spoken gently with you Why does your heart carry you away And what do your eyes wink at That you turn your spirit against God And let such words go out of your mouth What is man that he could be pure And he who is born of a woman that he could be righteous If God puts no trust in His saints And the heavens are not pure in His sight How much less man who is abominable and filthy Who drinks iniquity like water I will tell you hear me What I have seen I will declare What wise men have told Not hiding anything received from their fathers To whom alone the land was given And no alien passed among them The wicked man writhes with pain all his days And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor
Dreadful sounds are in his ears In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him
He does not believe that he will return from darkness For a sword is wai ng for him
He wanders about for bread saying Where is it He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand
Trouble and anguish make him afraid They overpower him like a king ready for ba le
For he stretches out his hand against God And acts defiantly against the Almighty Running stubbornly against Him With his strong embossed shield
Though he has covered his face with his fatness And made his waist heavy with fat He dwells in desolate ci es In houses which no one inhabits Which are des ned to become ruins
He will not be rich Nor will his wealth con nue Nor will his possessions overspread the earth
He will not depart from darkness The flame will dry out his branches And by the breath of His mouth he will go away
Let him not trust in fu le things deceiving himself For fu lity will be his reward
It will be accomplished before his me And his branch will not be green
He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine And cast off his blossom like an olive tree
For the company of hypocrites will be barren And fire will consume the tents of bribery
They conceive trouble and bring forth fu lity Their womb prepares deceit
Then Job answered and said I have heard many such things Miserable comforters are you all Shall words of wind have an end Or what provokes you that you answer I also could speak as you do If your soul were in my soul s place
I could heap up words against you And shake my head at you But I would strengthen you with my mouth And the comfort of my lips would relieve your grief
Though I speak my grief is not relieved And if I remain silent how am I eased But now He has worn me out You have made desolate all my company
You have shriveled me up And it is a witness against me My leanness rises up against me And bears witness to my face
He tears me in His wrath and hates me He gnashes at me with His teeth My adversary sharpens His gaze on me
They gape at me with their mouth They strike me reproachfully on the cheek They gather together against me
God has delivered me to the ungodly And turned me over to the hands of the wicked
I was at ease but He has sha ered me He also has taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces He has set me up for His target His archers surround me
He pierces my heart and does not pity He pours out my gall on the ground
He breaks me with wound upon wound He runs at me like a warrior
I have sewn sackcloth over my skin And laid my head in the dust
My face is flushed from weeping And on my eyelids is the shadow of death Although no violence is in my hands And my prayer is pure
O earth do not cover my blood And let my cry have no res ng place Surely even now my witness is in heaven And my evidence is on high
My friends scorn me My eyes pour out tears to God
Oh that one might plead for a man with God As a man pleads for his neighbor For when a few years are finished I shall go the way of no return
My spirit is broken My days are ex nguished The grave is ready for me
Are not mockers with me And does not my eye dwell on their provoca on Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself
Who is he who will shake hands with me For You have hidden their heart from understanding Therefore You will not exalt them
He who speaks fla ery to his friends Even the eyes of his children will fail
But He has made me a byword of the people And I have become one in whose face men spit
My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow And all my members are like shadows
Upright men are astonished at this And the innocent s rs himself up against the hypocrite
Yet the righteous will hold to his way And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger
But please come back again all of you For I shall not find one wise man among you
My days are past My purposes are broken off Even the thoughts of my heart
They change the night into day The light is near they say in the face of darkness
If I wait for the grave as my house If I make my bed in the darkness If I say to corrup on You are my father And to the worm You are my mother and my sister Where then is my hope As for my hope who can see it Will they go down to the gates of Sheol Shall we have rest together in the dust Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said How long ll you put an end to words Gain understanding and a erward we will speak
Why are we counted as beasts And regarded as stupid in your sight You who tear yourself in anger Shall the earth be forsaken for you Or shall the rock be removed from its place The light of the wicked indeed goes out And the flame of his fire does not shine
The light is dark in his tent And his lamp beside him is put out
The steps of his strength are shortened And his own counsel casts him down
For he is cast into a net by his own feet And he walks into a snare
The net takes him by the heel And a snare lays hold of him
A noose is hidden for him on the ground And a trap for him in the road
Terrors frighten him on every side And drive him to his feet
His strength is starved And destruc on is ready at his side
It devours patches of his skin The firstborn of death devours his limbs
He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent And they parade him before the king of terrors
They dwell in his tent who are none of his Brimstone is sca ered on his dwelling
His roots are dried out below And his branch withers above
The memory of him perishes from the earth And he has no name among the renowned
He is driven from light into darkness And chased out of the world
He has neither son nor posterity among his people Nor any remaining in his dwellings
Those in the west are astonished at his day As those in the east are frightened
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked And this is the place of him who does not know God
Then Job answered and said How long will you torment my soul And break me in pieces with words These ten mes you have reproached me You are not ashamed that you have wronged me
And if indeed I have erred My error remains with me
If indeed you exalt yourselves against me And plead my disgrace against me Know then that God has wronged me And has surrounded me with His net
If I cry out concerning wrong I am not heard
If I cry aloud there is no jus ce
He has fenced up my way so that I cannot pass And He has set darkness in my paths
He has stripped me of my glory And taken the crown from my head
He breaks me down on every side And I am gone My hope He has uprooted like a tree
He has also kindled His wrath against me And He counts me as one of His enemies
His troops come together And build up their road against me They encamp all around my tent
He has removed my brothers far from me And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me
My rela ves have failed And my close friends have forgo en me
Those who dwell in my house and my maidservants Count me as a stranger I am an alien in their sight
I call my servant but he gives no answer I beg him with my mouth
My breath is offensive to my wife And I am repulsive to the children of my own body
Even young children despise me I arise and they speak against me
All my close friends abhor me And those whom I love have turned against me
My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth
Have pity on me have pity on me O you my friends For the hand of God has struck me Why do you persecute me as God does And are not sa sfied with my flesh Oh that my words were wri en Oh that they were inscribed in a book That they were engraved on a rock With an iron pen and lead forever For I know that my Redeemer lives And He shall stand at last on the earth And a er my skin is destroyed this I know That in my flesh I shall see God Whom I shall see for myself And my eyes shall behold and not another
How my heart yearns within me If you should say How shall we persecute him Since the root of the ma er is found in me Be afraid of the sword for yourselves For wrath brings the punishment of the sword That you may know there is a judgment
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer Because of the turmoil within me
I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer
Do you not know this of old Since man was placed on earth That the triumphing of the wicked is short And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment Though his haugh ness mounts up to the heavens And his head reaches to the clouds Yet he will perish forever like his own refuse Those who have seen him will say Where is he He will fly away like a dream and not be found Yes he will be chased away like a vision of the night
The eye that saw him will see him no more Nor will his place behold him anymore
His children will seek the favor of the poor And his hands will restore his wealth
His bones are full of his youthful vigor But it will lie down with him in the dust
Though evil is sweet in his mouth And he hides it under his tongue Though he spares it and does not forsake it But s ll keeps it in his mouth Yet his food in his stomach turns sour It becomes cobra venom within him
He swallows down riches And vomits them up again God casts them out of his belly
He will suck the poison of cobras The viper s tongue will slay him
He will not see the streams The rivers flowing with honey and cream
He will restore that for which he labored And will not swallow it down From the proceeds of business He will get no enjoyment
For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor He has violently seized a house which he did not build
Because he knows no quietness in his heart He will not save anything he desires
Nothing is le for him to eat Therefore his well being will not last
In his self sufficiency he will be in distress Every hand of misery will come against him
When he is about to fill his stomach God will cast on him the fury of His wrath And will rain it on him while he is ea ng
He will flee from the iron weapon A bronze bow will pierce him through
It is drawn and comes out of the body Yes the gli ering point comes out of his gall
Terrors come upon him Total darkness is reserved for his treasures
An unfanned fire will consume him It shall go ill with him who is le in his tent
The heavens will reveal his iniquity And the earth will rise up against him
The increase of his house will depart And his goods will flow away in the day of His wrath
This is the por on from God for a wicked man The heritage appointed to him by God
Then Job answered and said Listen carefully to my speech And let this be your consola on
Bear with me that I may speak And a er I have spoken keep mocking
As for me is my complaint against man And if it were why should I not be impa ent Look at me and be astonished Put your hand over your mouth
Even when I remember I am terrified And trembling takes hold of my flesh
Why do the wicked live and become old Yes become mighty in power Their descendants are established with them in their sight And their offspring before their eyes
Their houses are safe from fear Neither is the rod of God upon them
Their bull breeds without failure Their cow calves without miscarriage
They send forth their li le ones like a flock And their children dance
They sing to the tambourine and harp And rejoice to the sound of the flute
They spend their days in wealth And in a moment go down to the grave
Yet they say to God Depart from us For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways
Who is the Almighty that we should serve Him And what profit do we have if we pray to Him Indeed their prosperity is not in their hand The counsel of the wicked is far from me
How o en is the lamp of the wicked put out How o en does their destruc on come upon them The sorrows God distributes in His anger They are like straw before the wind And like chaff that a storm carries away
They say God lays up one s iniquity for his children Let Him recompense him that he may know it
Let his eyes see his destruc on And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty
For what does he care about his household a er him When the number of his months is cut in half Can anyone teach God knowledge Since He judges those on high One dies in his full strength Being wholly at ease and secure His pails are full of milk And the marrow of his bones is moist
Another man dies in the bi erness of his soul Never having eaten with pleasure
They lie down alike in the dust And worms cover them
Look I know your thoughts And the schemes with which you would wrong me
For you say Where is the house of the prince And where is the tent The dwelling place of the wicked Have you not asked those who travel the road And do you not know their signs For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom They shall be brought out on the day of wrath
Who condemns his way to his face And who repays him for what he has done Yet he shall be brought to the grave And a vigil kept over the tomb
The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him Everyone shall follow him As countless have gone before him
How then can you comfort me with empty words Since falsehood remains in your answers Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said Can a man be profitable to God Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways blameless Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you And enters into judgment with you Is not your wickedness great And your iniquity without end For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason And stripped the naked of their clothing
You have not given the weary water to drink And you have withheld bread from the hungry
But the mighty man possessed the land And the honorable man dwelt in it
You have sent widows away empty And the strength of the fatherless was crushed
Therefore snares are all around you And sudden fear troubles you Or darkness so that you cannot see And an abundance of water covers you
Is not God in the height of heaven And see the highest stars how lo y they are And you say What does God know Can He judge through the deep darkness Thick clouds cover Him so that He cannot see And He walks above the circle of heaven
Will you keep to the old way Which wicked men have trod Who were cut down before their me Whose founda ons were swept away by a flood They said to God Depart from us What can the Almighty do to them Yet He filled their houses with good things But the counsel of the wicked is far from me
The righteous see it and are glad And the innocent laugh at them Surely our adversaries are cut down And the fire consumes their remnant
Now acquaint yourself with Him and be at peace Thereby good will come to you
Receive please instruc on from His mouth And lay up His words in your heart
If you return to the Almighty you will be built up You will remove iniquity far from your tents
Then you will lay your gold in the dust And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks
Yes the Almighty will be your gold And your precious silver For then you will have your delight in the Almighty And li up your face to God
You will make your prayer to Him He will hear you And you will pay your vows
You will also declare a thing And it will be established for you So light will shine on your ways
When they cast you down and you say Exalta on will come Then He will save the humble person
He will even deliver one who is not innocent Yes he will be delivered by the purity of your hands
Then Job answered and said Even today my complaint is bi er My hand is listless because of my groaning
Oh that I knew where I might find Him That I might come to His seat I would present my case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments
I would know the words which He would answer me And understand what He would say to me
Would He contend with me in His great power No But He would take note of me
There the upright could reason with Him And I would be delivered forever from my Judge
Look I go forward but He is not there And backward but I cannot perceive Him When He works on the le hand I cannot behold Him When He turns to the right hand I cannot see Him
But He knows the way that I take When He has tested me I shall come forth as gold
My foot has held fast to His steps I have kept His way and not turned aside
I have not departed from the commandment of His lips I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food
But He is unique and who can make Him change And whatever His soul desires that He does
For He performs what is appointed for me And many such things are with Him
Therefore I am terrified at His presence When I consider this I am afraid of Him
For God made my heart weak And the Almighty terrifies me Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness And He did not hide deep darkness from my face
Since mes are not hidden from the Almighty Why do those who know Him see not His days Some remove landmarks They seize flocks violently and feed on them They drive away the donkey of the fatherless They take the widow s ox as a pledge
They push the needy off the road All the poor of the land are forced to hide
Indeed like wild donkeys in the desert They go out to their work searching for food
The wilderness yields food for them and for their children
They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked
They spend the night naked without clothing And have no covering in the cold
They are wet with the showers of the mountains And huddle around the rock for want of shelter
Some snatch the fatherless from the breast And take a pledge from the poor
They cause the poor to go naked without clothing And they take away the sheaves from the hungry
They press out oil within their walls And tread winepresses yet suffer thirst
The dying groan in the city And the souls of the wounded cry out Yet God does not charge them with wrong
There are those who rebel against the light They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths
The murderer rises with the light He kills the poor and needy And in the night he is like a thief
The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight Saying No eye will see me And he disguises his face
In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the day me They do not know the light
For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death If someone recognizes them They are in the terrors of the shadow of death
They should be swi on the face of the waters Their por on should be cursed in the earth So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards
As drought and heat consume the snow waters So the grave consumes those who have sinned
The womb should forget him The worm should feed sweetly on him He should be remembered no more And wickedness should be broken like a tree
For he preys on the barren who do not bear And does no good for the widow
But God draws the mighty away with His power He rises up but no man is sure of life
He gives them security and they rely on it Yet His eyes are on their ways
They are exalted for a li le while Then they are gone
They are brought low They are taken out of the way like all others They dry out like the heads of grain
Now if it is not so who will prove me a liar And make my speech worth nothing Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said Dominion and fear belong to Him He makes peace in His high places
Is there any number to His armies Upon whom does His light not rise How then can man be righteous before God Or how can he be pure who is born of a woman If even the moon does not shine And the stars are not pure in His sight How much less man who is a maggot And a son of man who is a worm But Job answered and said How have you helped him who is without power How have you saved the arm that has no strength How have you counseled one who has no wisdom And how have you declared sound advice to many To whom have you u ered words And whose spirit came from you The dead tremble Those under the waters and those inhabi ng them
Sheol is naked before Him And Destruc on has no covering
He stretches out the north over empty space He hangs the earth on nothing
He binds up the water in His thick clouds Yet the clouds are not broken under it
He covers the face of His throne And spreads His cloud over it
He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness
The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at His rebuke
He s rs up the sea with His power And by His understanding He breaks up the storm
By His Spirit He adorned the heavens His hand pierced the fleeing serpent
Indeed these are the mere edges of His ways And how small a whisper we hear of Him But the thunder of His power who can understand Moreover Job con nued his discourse and said As God lives who has taken away my jus ce And the Almighty who has made my soul bi er As long as my breath is in me And the breath of God in my nostrils My lips will not speak wickedness Nor my tongue u er deceit
Far be it from me That I should say you are right Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me
My righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go My heart shall not reproach me as long as I live
May my enemy be like the wicked And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous
For what is the hope of the hypocrite Though he may gain much If God takes away his life Will God hear his cry When trouble comes upon him Will he delight himself in the Almighty Will he always call on God I will teach you about the hand of God What is with the Almighty I will not conceal
Surely all of you have seen it Why then do you behave with complete nonsense This is the por on of a wicked man with God And the heritage of oppressors received from the Almighty If his children are mul plied it is for the sword And his offspring shall not be sa sfied with bread
Those who survive him shall be buried in death And their widows shall not weep Though he heaps up silver like dust And piles up clothing like clay He may pile it up but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver
He builds his house like a moth Like a booth which a watchman makes
The rich man will lie down But not be gathered up He opens his eyes And he is no more
Terrors overtake him like a flood A tempest steals him away in the night
The east wind carries him away and he is gone It sweeps him out of his place
It hurls against him and does not spare He flees desperately from its power
Men shall clap their hands at him And shall hiss him out of his place
Surely there is a mine for silver And a place where gold is refined
Iron is taken from the earth And copper is smelted from ore
Man puts an end to darkness And searches every recess For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death
He breaks open a sha away from people In places forgo en by feet They hang far away from men They swing to and fro
As for the earth from it comes bread But underneath it is turned up as by fire Its stones are the source of sapphires And it contains gold dust
That path no bird knows Nor has the falcon s eye seen it
The proud lions have not trodden it Nor has the fierce lion passed over it
He puts his hand on the flint He overturns the mountains at the roots
He cuts out channels in the rocks And his eye sees every precious thing
He dams up the streams from trickling What is hidden he brings forth to light
But where can wisdom be found And where is the place of understanding Man does not know its value Nor is it found in the land of the living
The deep says It is not in me And the sea says It is not with me
It cannot be purchased for gold Nor can silver be weighed for its price
It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir In precious onyx or sapphire
Neither gold nor crystal can equal it Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold
No men on shall be made of coral or quartz For the price of wisdom is above rubies
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it Nor can it be valued in pure gold
From where then does wisdom come And where is the place of understanding It is hidden from the eyes of all living And concealed from the birds of the air
Destruc on and Death say We have heard a report about it with our ears
God understands its way And He knows its place
For He looks to the ends of the earth And sees under the whole heavens To establish a weight for the wind And appor on the waters by measure
When He made a law for the rain And a path for the thunderbolt Then He saw wisdom and declared it He prepared it indeed He searched it out
And to man He said Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom And to depart from evil is understanding
Job further con nued his discourse and said Oh that I were as in months past As in the days when God watched over me When His lamp shone upon my head And when by His light I walked through darkness Just as I was in the days of my prime When the friendly counsel of God was over my tent When the Almighty was yet with me When my children were around me When my steps were bathed with cream And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me When I went out to the gate by the city When I took my seat in the open square The young men saw me and hid And the aged arose and stood The princes refrained from talking And put their hand on their mouth The voice of nobles was hushed And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth
When the ear heard then it blessed me And when the eye saw then it approved me Because I delivered the poor who cried out The fatherless and the one who had no helper
The blessing of a perishing man came upon me And I caused the widow s heart to sing for joy
I put on righteousness and it clothed me My jus ce was like a robe and a turban
I was eyes to the blind And I was feet to the lame
I was a father to the poor And I searched out the case that I did not know
I broke the fangs of the wicked And plucked the vic m from his teeth
Then I said I shall die in my nest And mul ply my days as the sand
My root is spread out to the waters And the dew lies all night on my branch
My glory is fresh within me And my bow is renewed in my hand
Men listened to me and waited And kept silence for my counsel
A er my words they did not speak again And my speech se led on them as dew
They waited for me as for the rain And they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain
If I mocked at them they did not believe it And the light of my countenance they did not cast down
I chose the way for them and sat as chief So I dwelt as a king in the army As one who comforts mourners
But now they mock at me men younger than I Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock
Indeed what profit is the strength of their hands to me Their vigor has perished
They are gaunt from want and famine Fleeing late to the wilderness desolate and waste Who pluck mallow by the bushes And broom tree roots for their food
They were driven out from among men They shouted at them as at a thief
They had to live in the cle s of the valleys In caves of the earth and the rocks
Among the bushes they brayed Under the ne les they nestled
They were sons of fools Yes sons of vile men They were scourged from the land
And now I am their taun ng song Yes I am their byword
They abhor me they keep far from me They do not hesitate to spit in my face
Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me They have cast off restraint before me
At my right hand the rabble arises They push away my feet And they raise against me their ways of destruc on
They break up my path They promote my calamity They have no helper
They come as broad breakers Under the ruinous storm they roll along
Terrors are turned upon me They pursue my honor as the wind And my prosperity has passed like a cloud
And now my soul is poured out because of my plight The days of afflic on take hold of me
My bones are pierced in me at night And my gnawing pains take no rest
By great force my garment is disfigured It binds me about as the collar of my coat
He has cast me into the mire And I have become like dust and ashes
I cry out to You but You do not answer me I stand up and You regard me
But You have become cruel to me With the strength of Your hand You oppose me
You li me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it You spoil my success
For I know that You will bring me to death And to the house appointed for all living
Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins If they cry out when He destroys it
Have I not wept for him who was in trouble Has not my soul grieved for the poor But when I looked for good evil came to me And when I waited for light then came darkness
My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest Days of afflic on confront me
I go about mourning but not in the sun I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help
I am a brother of jackals And a companion of ostriches
My skin grows black and falls from me My bones burn with fever
My harp is turned to mourning And my flute to the voice of those who weep
I have made a covenant with my eyes Why then should I look upon a young woman For what is the allotment of God from above And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high Is it not destruc on for the wicked And disaster for the workers of iniquity Does He not see my ways And count all my steps If I have walked with falsehood Or if my foot has hastened to deceit Let me be weighed on honest scales That God may know my integrity
If my step has turned from the way Or my heart walked a er my eyes Or if any spot adheres to my hands Then let me sow and another eat Yes let my harvest be rooted out
If my heart has been en ced by a woman Or if I have lurked at my neighbor s door Then let my wife grind for another And let others bow down over her
For that would be wickedness Yes it would be iniquity deserving of judgment
For that would be a fire that consumes to destruc on And would root out all my increase
If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me What then shall I do when God rises up When He punishes how shall I answer Him Did not He who made me in the womb make them Did not the same One fashion us in the womb If I have kept the poor from their desire Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail Or eaten my morsel by myself So that the fatherless could not eat of it But from my youth I reared him as a father And from my mother s womb I guided the widow If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing Or any poor man without covering If his heart has not blessed me And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep If I have raised my hand against the fatherless When I saw I had help in the gate Then let my arm fall from my shoulder Let my arm be torn from the socket
For destruc on from God is a terror to me And because of His magnificence I cannot endure
If I have made gold my hope Or said to fine gold You are my confidence If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great And because my hand had gained much If I have observed the sun when it shines Or the moon moving in brightness So that my heart has been secretly en ced And my mouth has kissed my hand This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment For I would have denied God who is above
If I have rejoiced at the destruc on of him who hated me Or li ed myself up when evil found him Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his soul If the men of my tent have not said Who is there that has not been sa sfied with his meat But no sojourner had to lodge in the street For I have opened my doors to the traveler If I have covered my transgressions as Adam By hiding my iniquity in my bosom Because I feared the great mul tude And dreaded the contempt of families So that I kept silence And did not go out of the door Oh that I had one to hear me Here is my mark
Oh that the Almighty would answer me That my Prosecutor had wri en a book Surely I would carry it on my shoulder And bind it on me like a crown I would declare to Him the number of my steps Like a prince I would approach Him
If my land cries out against me And its furrows weep together If I have eaten its fruit without money Or caused its owners to lose their lives Then let thistles grow instead of wheat And weeds instead of barley
The words of Job are ended
So these three men ceased answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes
Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the family of Ram was aroused against Job his wrath was aroused because he jus fied himself rather than God
Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused because they had found no answer and yet had condemned Job
Now because they were years older than he Elihu had waited to speak to Job
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men his wrath was aroused
So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said I am young in years and you are very old Therefore I was afraid And dared not declare my opinion to you
I said Age should speak And mul tude of years should teach wisdom
But there is a spirit in man And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding
Great men are not always wise Nor do the aged always understand jus ce
Therefore I say Listen to me I also will declare my opinion
Indeed I waited for your words I listened to your reasonings while you searched out what to say
I paid close a en on to you And surely not one of you convinced Job Or answered his words Lest you say We have found wisdom God will vanquish him not man
Now he has not directed his words against me So I will not answer him with your words
They are dismayed and answer no more Words escape them
And I have waited because they did not speak Because they stood s ll and answered no more
I also will answer my part I too will declare my opinion
For I am full of words The spirit within me compels me
Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent It is ready to burst like new wineskins
I will speak that I may find relief I must open my lips and answer
Let me not I pray show par ality to anyone Nor let me fla er any man
For I do not know how to fla er Else my Maker would soon take me away
But please Job hear my speech And listen to all my words
Now I open my mouth My tongue speaks in my mouth
My words come from my upright heart My lips u er pure knowledge
The Spirit of God has made me And the breath of the Almighty gives me life
If you can answer me Set your words in order before me Take your stand
Truly I am as your spokesman before God I also have been formed out of clay
Surely no fear of me will terrify you Nor will my hand be heavy on you
Surely you have spoken in my hearing And I have heard the sound of your words saying I am pure without transgression I am innocent and there is no iniquity in me
Yet He finds occasions against me He counts me as His enemy He puts my feet in the stocks He watches all my paths
Look in this you are not righteous
I will answer you For God is greater than man
Why do you contend with Him For He does not give an accoun ng of any of His words
For God may speak in one way or in another Yet man does not perceive it
In a dream in a vision of the night When deep sleep falls upon men While slumbering on their beds Then He opens the ears of men And seals their instruc on
In order to turn man from his deed And conceal pride from man He keeps back his soul from the Pit And his life from perishing by the sword
Man is also chastened with pain on his bed And with strong pain in many of his bones So that his life abhors bread And his soul succulent food
His flesh wastes away from sight And his bones s ck out which once were not seen
Yes his soul draws near the Pit And his life to the execu oners
If there is a messenger for him A mediator one among a thousand To show man His uprightness Then He is gracious to him and says Deliver him from going down to the Pit I have found a ransom His flesh shall be young like a child s He shall return to the days of his youth
He shall pray to God and He will delight in him He shall see His face with joy For He restores to man His righteousness
Then he looks at men and says I have sinned and perverted what was right And it did not profit me
He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit And his life shall see the light
Behold God works all these things Twice in fact three mes with a man To bring back his soul from the Pit That he may be enlightened with the light of life
Give ear Job listen to me Hold your peace and I will speak
If you have anything to say answer me Speak for I desire to jus fy you
If not listen to me Hold your peace and I will teach you wisdom
Elihu further answered and said Hear my words you wise men Give ear to me you who have knowledge
For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food
Let us choose jus ce for ourselves Let us know among ourselves what is good
For Job has said I am righteous But God has taken away my jus ce Should I lie concerning my right My wound is incurable though I am without transgression
What man is like Job Who drinks scorn like water Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity And walks with wicked men For he has said It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God
Therefore listen to me you men of understanding Far be it from God to do wickedness And from the Almighty to commit iniquity
For He repays man according to his work And makes man to find a reward according to his way
Surely God will never do wickedly Nor will the Almighty pervert jus ce
Who gave Him charge over the earth Or who appointed Him over the whole world If He should set His heart on it If He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath All flesh would perish together And man would return to dust
If you have understanding hear this listen to the sound of my words Should one who hates jus ce govern Will you condemn Him who is most just Is it fi ng to say to a king You are worthless And to nobles You are wicked Yet He is not par al to princes Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor For they are all the work of His hands
In a moment they die in the middle of the night The people are shaken and pass away The mighty are taken away without a hand
For His eyes are on the ways of man And He sees all his steps
There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves
For He need not further consider a man That he should go before God in judgment
He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry And sets others in their place
Therefore he knows their works He overthrows them in the night And they are crushed
He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others Because they turned back from Him And would not consider any of His ways So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him For He hears the cry of the afflicted
When He gives quietness who then can make trouble And when He hides His face who then can see Him Whether it is against a na on or a man alone That the hypocrite should not reign Lest the people be ensnared
For has anyone said to God I have borne chastening I will offend no more Teach me what I do not see If I have done iniquity I will do no more Should He repay it according to your terms Just because you disavow it You must choose and not I Therefore speak what you know
Men of understanding say to me Wise men who listen to me Job speaks without knowledge His words are without wisdom
Oh that Job were tried to the utmost Because his answers are like those of wicked men For he adds rebellion to his sin He claps his hands among us And mul plies his words against God
Moreover Elihu answered and said Do you think this is right Do you say My righteousness is more than God s For you say What advantage will it be to You What profit shall I have more than if I had sinned I will answer you And your companions with you
Look to the heavens and see And behold the clouds They are higher than you
If you sin what do you accomplish against Him Or if your transgressions are mul plied what do you do to Him If you are righteous what do you give Him Or what does He receive from your hand Your wickedness affects a man such as you And your righteousness a son of man
Because of the mul tude of oppressions they cry out They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty
But no one says Where is God my Maker Who gives songs in the night Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven There they cry out but He does not answer Because of the pride of evil men
Surely God will not listen to empty talk Nor will the Almighty regard it
Although you say you do not see Him Yet jus ce is before Him and you must wait for Him
And now because He has not punished in His anger Nor taken much no ce of folly Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain He mul plies words without knowledge
Elihu also proceeded and said Bear with me a li le and I will show you That there are yet words to speak on God s behalf
I will fetch my knowledge from afar I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker
For truly my words are not false One who is perfect in knowledge is with you
Behold God is mighty but despises no one He is mighty in strength of understanding
He does not preserve the life of the wicked But gives jus ce to the oppressed
He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous But they are on the throne with kings For He has seated them forever And they are exalted
And if they are bound in fe ers Held in the cords of afflic on Then He tells them their work and their transgressions That they have acted defiantly
He also opens their ear to instruc on And commands that they turn from iniquity
If they obey and serve Him They shall spend their days in prosperity And their years in pleasures
But if they do not obey They shall perish by the sword And they shall die without knowledge
But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath They do not cry for help when He binds them
They die in youth And their life ends among the perverted persons
He delivers the poor in their afflic on And opens their ears in oppression
Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress Into a broad place where there is no restraint And what is set on your table would be full of richness
But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked Judgment and jus ce take hold of you
Because there is wrath beware lest He take you away with one blow For a large ransom would not help you avoid it
Will your riches Or all the mighty forces Keep you from distress Do not desire the night When people are cut off in their place
Take heed do not turn to iniquity For you have chosen this rather than afflic on
Behold God is exalted by His power Who teaches like Him Who has assigned Him His way Or who has said You have done wrong Remember to magnify His work Of which men have sung
Everyone has seen it Man looks on it from afar
Behold God is great and we do not know Him Nor can the number of His years be discovered
For He draws up drops of water Which dis ll as rain from the mist Which the clouds drop down And pour abundantly on man
Indeed can anyone understand the spreading of clouds The thunder from His canopy Look He sca ers his light upon it And covers the depths of the sea
For by these He judges the peoples He gives food in abundance
He covers His hands with lightning And commands it to strike
His thunder declares it The ca le also concerning the rising storm
At this also my heart trembles And leaps from its place
Hear a en vely the thunder of His voice And the rumbling that comes from His mouth
He sends it forth under the whole heaven His lightning to the ends of the earth
A er it a voice roars He thunders with His majes c voice And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard
God thunders marvelously with His voice He does great things which we cannot comprehend
For He says to the snow Fall on the earth Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength
He seals the hand of every man That all men may know His work
The beasts go into dens And remain in their lairs
From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind And cold from the sca ering winds of the north
By the breath of God ice is given And the broad waters are frozen
Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds He sca ers His bright clouds
And they swirl about being turned by His guidance That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of the whole earth
He causes it to come Whether for correc on Or for His land Or for mercy
Listen to this O Job Stand s ll and consider the wondrous works of God
Do you know when God dispatches them And causes the light of His cloud to shine Do you know how the clouds are balanced Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge Why are your garments hot When He quiets the earth by the south wind With Him have you spread out the skies Strong as a cast metal mirror Teach us what we should say to Him For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness
Should He be told that I wish to speak If a man were to speak surely he would be swallowed up
Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies When the wind has passed and cleared them
He comes from the north as golden splendor With God is awesome majesty
As for the Almighty we cannot find Him He is excellent in power In judgment and abundant jus ce He does not oppress
Therefore men fear Him He shows no par ality to any who are wise of heart
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said Who is this who darkens counsel By words without knowledge Now prepare yourself like a man I will ques on you and you shall answer Me
Where were you when I laid the founda ons of the earth Tell Me if you have understanding
Who determined its measurements Surely you know Or who stretched the line upon it To what were its founda ons fastened Or who laid its cornerstone When the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy Or who shut in the sea with doors When it burst forth and issued from the womb When I made the clouds its garment And thick darkness its swaddling band When I fixed My limit for it And set bars and doors When I said This far you may come but no farther And here your proud waves must stop Have you commanded the morning since your days began And caused the dawn to know its place That it might take hold of the ends of the earth And the wicked be shaken out of it It takes on form like clay under a seal And stands out like a garment
From the wicked their light is withheld And the upraised arm is broken
Have you entered the springs of the sea Or have you walked in search of the depths Have the gates of death been revealed to you Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth Tell Me if you know all this
Where is the way to the dwelling of light And darkness where is its place That you may take it to its territory That you may know the paths to its home Do you know it because you were born then Or because the number of your days is great Have you entered the treasury of snow Or have you seen the treasury of hail Which I have reserved for the me of trouble For the day of ba le and war By what way is light diffused Or the east wind sca ered over the earth Who has divided a channel for the overflowing water Or a path for the thunderbolt To cause it to rain on a land where there is no one A wilderness in which there is no man To sa sfy the desolate waste And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass Has the rain a father Or who has bego en the drops of dew From whose womb comes the ice And the frost of heaven who gives it birth The waters harden like stone And the surface of the deep is frozen
Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades Or loose the belt of Orion Can you bring out Mazzaroth in its season Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs Do you know the ordinances of the heavens Can you set their dominion over the earth Can you li up your voice to the clouds That an abundance of water may cover you Can you send out lightnings that they may go And say to you Here we are Who has put wisdom in the mind Or who has given understanding to the heart Who can number the clouds by wisdom Or who can pour out the bo les of heaven When the dust hardens in clumps And the clods cling together Can you hunt the prey for the lion Or sa sfy the appe te of the young lions When they crouch in their dens Or lurk in their lairs to lie in wait Who provides food for the raven When its young ones cry to God And wander about for lack of food Do you know the me when the wild mountain goats bear young Or can you mark when the deer gives birth Can you number the months that they fulfill Or do you know the me when they bear young They bow down They bring forth their young They deliver their offspring
Their young ones are healthy They grow strong with grain They depart and do not return to them
Who set the wild donkey free Who loosed the bonds of the onager Whose home I have made the wilderness And the barren land his dwelling He scorns the tumult of the city He does not heed the shouts of the driver
The range of the mountains is his pasture And he searches a er every green thing
Will the wild ox be willing to serve you Will he bed by your manger Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes Or will he plow the valleys behind you Will you trust him because his strength is great Or will you leave your labor to him Will you trust him to bring home your grain And gather it to your threshing floor The wings of the ostrich wave proudly But are her wings and pinions like the kindly stork s For she leaves her eggs on the ground And warms them in the dust She forgets that a foot may crush them Or that a wild beast may break them
She treats her young harshly as though they were not hers Her labor is in vain without concern Because God deprived her of wisdom And did not endow her with understanding
When she li s herself on high She scorns the horse and its rider
Have you given the horse strength Have you clothed his neck with thunder Can you frighten him like a locust His majes c snor ng strikes terror
He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength He gallops into the clash of arms
He mocks at fear and is not frightened Nor does he turn back from the sword
The quiver ra les against him The gli ering spear and javelin
He devours the distance with fierceness and rage Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet has sounded
At the blast of the trumpet he says Aha He smells the ba le from afar The thunder of captains and shou ng
Does the hawk fly by your wisdom And spread its wings toward the south Does the eagle mount up at your command And make its nest on high On the rocks it dwells and resides On the crag of the rock and the stronghold
From there it spies out the prey Its eyes observe from afar
Its young ones suck up blood And where the slain are there it is
Moreover the LORD answered Job and said Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him He who rebukes God let him answer it
Then Job answered the LORD and said Behold I am vile What shall I answer You I lay my hand over my mouth
Once I have spoken but I will not answer Yes twice but I will proceed no further
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said Now prepare yourself like a man I will ques on you and you shall answer Me Would you indeed annul My judgment Would you condemn Me that you may be jus fied Have you an arm like God Or can you thunder with a voice like His Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor and array yourself with glory and beauty
Disperse the rage of your wrath Look on everyone who is proud and humble him
Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low Tread down the wicked in their place
Hide them in the dust together Bind their faces in hidden darkness
Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you
Look now at the behemoth which I made along with you He eats grass like an ox
See now his strength is in his hips And his power is in his stomach muscles
He moves his tail like a cedar The sinews of his thighs are ghtly knit
His bones are like beams of bronze His ribs like bars of iron
He is the first of the ways of God Only He who made him can bring near His sword
Surely the mountains yield food for him And all the beasts of the field play there
He lies under the lotus trees In a covert of reeds and marsh
The lotus trees cover him with their shade The willows by the brook surround him
Indeed the river may rage Yet he is not disturbed He is confident though the Jordan gushes into his mouth Though he takes it in his eyes Or one pierces his nose with a snare
Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower Can you put a reed through his nose Or pierce his jaw with a hook Will he make many supplica ons to you Will he speak so ly to you Will he make a covenant with you Will you take him as a servant forever Will you play with him as with a bird Or will you leash him for your maidens Will your companions make a banquet of him Will they appor on him among the merchants Can you fill his skin with harpoons Or his head with fishing spears Lay your hand on him Remember the ba le Never do it again Indeed any hope of overcoming him is false Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him No one is so fierce that he would dare s r him up
Who then is able to stand against Me Who has preceded Me that I should pay him Everything under heaven is Mine
I will not conceal his limbs His mighty power or his graceful propor ons
Who can remove his outer coat Who can approach him with a double bridle Who can open the doors of his face With his terrible teeth all around His rows of scales are his pride Shut up ghtly as with a seal One is so near another That no air can come between them They are joined one to another They s ck together and cannot be parted
His sneezings flash forth light And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning
Out of his mouth go burning lights Sparks of fire shoot out
Smoke goes out of his nostrils As from a boiling pot and burning rushes
His breath kindles coals And a flame goes out of his mouth
Strength dwells in his neck And sorrow dances before him
The folds of his flesh are joined together They are firm on him and cannot be moved
His heart is as hard as stone Even as hard as the lower millstone
When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid Because of his crashings they are beside themselves
Though the sword reaches him it cannot avail Nor does spear dart or javelin
He regards iron as straw And bronze as ro en wood
The arrow cannot make him flee Slingstones become like stubble to him
Darts are regarded as straw He laughs at the threat of javelins
His undersides are like sharp potsherds He spreads pointed marks in the mire
He makes the deep boil like a pot He makes the sea like a pot of ointment
He leaves a shining wake behind him One would think the deep had white hair
On earth there is nothing like him Which is made without fear
He beholds every high thing He is king over all the children of pride
Then Job answered the LORD and said I know that You can do everything And that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You
You asked Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge Therefore I have u ered what I did not understand Things too wonderful for me which I did not know
Listen please and let me speak You said I will ques on you and you shall answer Me
I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear But now my eye sees You
Therefore I abhor myself And repent in dust and ashes
And so it was a er the LORD had spoken these words to Job that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends for you have not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has
Now therefore take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams go to My servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and My servant Job shall pray for you
For I will accept him lest I deal with you according to your folly because you have not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD commanded them for the LORD had accepted Job
And the LORD restored Job s losses when he prayed for his friends
Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before
Then all his brothers all his sisters and all those who had been his acquaintances before came to him and ate food with him in his house and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him
Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold
Now the LORD blessed the la er days of Job more than his beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep six thousand camels one thousand yoke of oxen and one thousand female donkeys
He also had seven sons and three daughters
And he called the name of the first Jemimah the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Keren Happuch
In all the land were found no women so beau ful as the daughters of Job and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers
A er this Job lived one hundred and forty years and saw his children and grandchildren for four genera ons
So Job died old and full of days
Psalms Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly Nor stands in the path of sinners Nor sits in the seat of the scornful But his delight is in the law of the LORD And in His law he meditates day and night
He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water That brings forth its fruit in its season Whose leaf also shall not wither And whatever he does shall prosper
The ungodly are not so But are like the chaff which the wind drives away
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment Nor sinners in the congrega on of the righteous
For the LORD knows the way of the righteous But the way of the ungodly shall perish
Why do the na ons rage And the people plot a vain thing The kings of the earth set themselves And the rulers take counsel together Against the LORD and against His Anointed saying Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh The Lord shall hold them in derision
Then He shall speak to them in His wrath And distress them in His deep displeasure Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion
I will declare the decree The LORD has said to Me You are My Son Today I have bego en You
Ask of Me and I will give You The na ons for Your inheritance And the ends of the earth for Your possession
You shall break them with a rod of iron You shall dash them to pieces like a po er s vessel
Now therefore be wise O kings Be instructed you judges of the earth
Serve the LORD with fear And rejoice with trembling
Kiss the Son lest He be angry And you perish in the way When His wrath is kindled but a li le
Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him
A Psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son
LORD how they have increased who trouble me Many are they who rise up against me
Many are they who say of me There is no help for him in God
Selah But You O LORD are a shield for me My glory and the One who li s up my head
I cried to the LORD with my voice And He heard me from His holy hill
Selah I lay down and slept I awoke for the LORD sustained me
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around
Arise O LORD Save me O my God For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone You have broken the teeth of the ungodly
Salva on belongs to the LORD
Your blessing is upon Your people
Selah To the Chief Musician
With stringed instruments
A Psalm of David
Hear me when I call O God of my righteousness You have relieved me in my distress Have mercy on me and hear my prayer
How long O you sons of men Will you turn my glory to shame How long will you love worthlessness And seek falsehood Selah But know that the LORD has set apart for Himself him who is godly The LORD will hear when I call to Him
Be angry and do not sin
Meditate within your heart on your bed and be s ll
Selah Offer the sacrifices of righteousness And put your trust in the LORD
There are many who say Who will show us any good LORD li up the light of Your countenance upon us
You have put gladness in my heart More than in the season that their grain and wine increased
I will both lie down in peace and sleep For You alone O LORD make me dwell in safety
To the Chief Musician
With flutes
A Psalm of David
Give ear to my words O LORD Consider my medita on
Give heed to the voice of my cry My King and my God For to You I will pray
My voice You shall hear in the morning O LORD In the morning I will direct it to You And I will look up
For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness Nor shall evil dwell with You
The boas ul shall not stand in Your sight You hate all workers of iniquity
You shall destroy those who speak falsehood The LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and decei ul man
But as for me I will come into Your house in the mul tude of Your mercy In fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple
Lead me O LORD in Your righteousness because of my enemies Make Your way straight before my face
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth Their inward part is destruc on Their throat is an open tomb They fla er with their tongue
Pronounce them guilty O God Let them fall by their own counsels Cast them out in the mul tude of their transgressions For they have rebelled against You
But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You Let them ever shout for joy because You defend them Let those also who love Your name Be joyful in You
For You O LORD will bless the righteous With favor You will surround him as with a shield

On an eight stringed harp
A Psalm of David
O LORD do not rebuke me in Your anger Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure
Have mercy on me O LORD for I am weak O LORD heal me for my bones are troubled
My soul also is greatly troubled But You O LORD how long Return O LORD deliver me Oh save me for Your mercies sake For in death there is no remembrance of You In the grave who will give You thanks I am weary with my groaning All night I make my bed swim I drench my couch with my tears
My eye wastes away because of grief It grows old because of all my enemies
Depart from me all you workers of iniquity For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping
The LORD has heard my supplica on The LORD will receive my prayer
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly
A Medita on of David which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite
O LORD my God in You I put my trust Save me from all those who persecute me And deliver me Lest they tear me like a lion Rending me in pieces while there is none to deliver
O LORD my God if I have done this If there is iniquity in my hands If I have repaid evil to him who was at peace with me Or have plundered my enemy without cause Let the enemy pursue me and overtake me Yes let him trample my life to the earth And lay my honor in the dust
Selah Arise O LORD in Your anger Li Yourself up because of the rage of my enemies Rise up for me to the judgment You have commanded So the congrega on of the peoples shall surround You For their sakes therefore return on high
The LORD shall judge the peoples Judge me O LORD according to my righteousness And according to my integrity within me
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end But establish the just For the righteous God tests the hearts and minds
My defense is of God Who saves the upright in heart
God is a just judge And God is angry with the wicked every day
If he does not turn back He will sharpen His sword He bends His bow and makes it ready
He also prepares for Himself instruments of death He makes His arrows into fiery sha s
Behold the wicked brings forth iniquity Yes he conceives trouble and brings forth falsehood
He made a pit and dug it out And has fallen into the ditch which he made
His trouble shall return upon his own head And his violent dealing shall come down on his own crown
I will praise the LORD according to His righteousness And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High

On the instrument of Gath
A Psalm of David
O LORD our Lord How excellent is Your name in all the earth Who have set Your glory above the heavens Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength Because of Your enemies That You may silence the enemy and the avenger
When I consider Your heavens the work of Your fingers The moon and the stars which You have ordained What is man that You are mindful of him And the son of man that You visit him For You have made him a li le lower than the angels And You have crowned him with glory and honor
You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands You have put all things under his feet All sheep and oxen Even the beasts of the field The birds of the air And the fish of the sea That pass through the paths of the seas
O LORD our Lord How excellent is Your name in all the earth To the Chief Musician
To the tune of Death of the Son
A Psalm of David
I will praise You O LORD with my whole heart I will tell of all Your marvelous works
I will be glad and rejoice in You I will sing praise to Your name O Most High
When my enemies turn back They shall fall and perish at Your presence
For You have maintained my right and my cause You sat on the throne judging in righteousness
You have rebuked the na ons You have destroyed the wicked You have blo ed out their name forever and ever
O enemy destruc ons are finished forever And you have destroyed ci es Even their memory has perished
But the LORD shall endure forever He has prepared His throne for judgment
He shall judge the world in righteousness And He shall administer judgment for the peoples in uprightness
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed A refuge in mes of trouble
And those who know Your name will put their trust in You For You LORD have not forsaken those who seek You
Sing praises to the LORD who dwells in Zion Declare His deeds among the people
When He avenges blood He remembers them He does not forget the cry of the humble
Have mercy on me O LORD Consider my trouble from those who hate me You who li me up from the gates of death That I may tell of all Your praise In the gates of the daughter of Zion
I will rejoice in Your salva on
The na ons have sunk down in the pit which they made In the net which they hid their own foot is caught
The LORD is known by the judgment He executes The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands
Medita on
Selah The wicked shall be turned into hell And all the na ons that forget God
For the needy shall not always be forgo en The expecta on of the poor shall not perish forever
Arise O LORD Do not let man prevail Let the na ons be judged in Your sight
Put them in fear O LORD That the na ons may know themselves to be but men
Selah Why do You stand afar off O LORD Why do You hide in mes of trouble The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised
For the wicked boasts of his heart s desire He blesses the greedy and renounces the LORD
The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek God God is in none of his thoughts
His ways are always prospering Your judgments are far above out of his sight As for all his enemies he sneers at them
He has said in his heart I shall not be moved I shall never be in adversity
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression Under his tongue is trouble and iniquity
He sits in the lurking places of the villages In the secret places he murders the innocent His eyes are secretly fixed on the helpless
He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den He lies in wait to catch the poor He catches the poor when he draws him into his net
So he crouches he lies low That the helpless may fall by his strength
He has said in his heart God has forgo en He hides His face He will never see
Arise O LORD O God li up Your hand Do not forget the humble
Why do the wicked renounce God He has said in his heart You will not require an account
But You have seen for You observe trouble and grief To repay it by Your hand
The helpless commits himself to You You are the helper of the fatherless
Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man Seek out his wickedness un l You find none
The LORD is King forever and ever The na ons have perished out of His land
LORD You have heard the desire of the humble You will prepare their heart You will cause Your ear to hear To do jus ce to the fatherless and the oppressed That the man of the earth may oppress no more
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
In the LORD I put my trust How can you say to my soul Flee as a bird to your mountain For look The wicked bend their bow They make ready their arrow on the string That they may shoot secretly at the upright in heart
If the founda ons are destroyed What can the righteous do The LORD is in His holy temple The LORD S throne is in heaven His eyes behold His eyelids test the sons of men
The LORD tests the righteous But the wicked and the one who loves violence His soul hates
Upon the wicked He will rain coals Fire and brimstone and a burning wind Shall be the por on of their cup
For the LORD is righteous He loves righteousness His countenance beholds the upright
To the Chief Musician
On an eight stringed harp
A Psalm of David
Help LORD for the godly man ceases For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men
They speak idly everyone with his neighbor With fla ering lips and a double heart they speak
May the LORD cut off all fla ering lips And the tongue that speaks proud things Who have said With our tongue we will prevail Our lips are our own Who is lord over us For the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy Now I will arise says the LORD I will set him in the safety for which he yearns
The words of the LORD are pure words Like silver tried in a furnace of earth Purified seven mes
You shall keep them O LORD You shall preserve them from this genera on forever
The wicked prowl on every side When vileness is exalted among the sons of men

A Psalm of David
How long O LORD Will You forget me forever How long will You hide Your face from me How long shall I take counsel in my soul Having sorrow in my heart daily How long will my enemy be exalted over me Consider and hear me O LORD my God Enlighten my eyes Lest I sleep the sleep of death Lest my enemy say I have prevailed against him Lest those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved
But I have trusted in Your mercy My heart shall rejoice in Your salva on
I will sing to the LORD Because He has dealt boun fully with me
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
The fool has said in his heart There is no God
They are corrupt They have done abominable works There is none who does good
The LORD looks down from heaven upon the children of men To see if there are any who understand who seek God
They have all turned aside They have together become corrupt There is none who does good No not one
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge Who eat up my people as they eat bread And do not call on the LORD There they are in great fear For God is with the genera on of the righteous
You shame the counsel of the poor But the LORD is his refuge
Oh that the salva on of Israel would come out of Zion When the LORD brings back the cap vity of His people Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad
A Psalm of David
LORD who may abide in Your tabernacle Who may dwell in Your holy hill He who walks uprightly And works righteousness And speaks the truth in his heart He who does not backbite with his tongue Nor does evil to his neighbor Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend In whose eyes a vile person is despised But he honors those who fear the LORD He who swears to his own hurt and does not change He who does not put out his money at usury Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent
He who does these things shall never be moved
A Michtam of David
Preserve me O God for in You I put my trust
O my soul you have said to the LORD You are my Lord My goodness is nothing apart from You
As for the saints who are on the earth They are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight
Their sorrows shall be mul plied who hasten a er another god Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer Nor take up their names on my lips
O LORD You are the por on of my inheritance and my cup You maintain my lot
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places Yes I have a good inheritance
I will bless the LORD who has given me counsel My heart also instructs me in the night seasons
I have set the LORD always before me Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved
Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My flesh also will rest in hope
For You will not leave my soul in Sheol Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corrup on
You will show me the path of life In Your presence is fullness of joy At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore
A Prayer of David
Hear a just cause O LORD A end to my cry Give ear to my prayer which is not from decei ul lips
Let my vindica on come from Your presence Let Your eyes look on the things that are upright
You have tested my heart You have visited me in the night You have tried me and have found nothing I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress
Concerning the works of men By the word of Your lips I have kept away from the paths of the destroyer
Uphold my steps in Your paths That my footsteps may not slip
I have called upon You for You will hear me O God Incline Your ear to me and hear my speech
Show Your marvelous lovingkindness by Your right hand O You who save those who trust in You From those who rise up against them
Keep me as the apple of Your eye Hide me under the shadow of Your wings From the wicked who oppress me From my deadly enemies who surround me
They have closed up their fat hearts With their mouths they speak proudly
They have now surrounded us in our steps They have set their eyes crouching down to the earth As a lion is eager to tear his prey And like a young lion lurking in secret places
Arise O LORD Confront him cast him down Deliver my life from the wicked with Your sword With Your hand from men O LORD From men of the world who have their por on in this life And whose belly You fill with Your hidden treasure
They are sa sfied with children And leave the rest of their possession for their babes
As for me I will see Your face in righteousness I shall be sa sfied when I awake in Your likeness
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD who spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul
And he said I will love You O LORD my strength
The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer My God my strength in whom I will trust My shield and the horn of my salva on my stronghold
I will call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised So shall I be saved from my enemies
The pangs of death surrounded me And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid
The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me The snares of death confronted me
In my distress I called upon the LORD And cried out to my God He heard my voice from His temple And my cry came before Him even to His ears
Then the earth shook and trembled The founda ons of the hills also quaked and were shaken Because He was angry
Smoke went up from His nostrils And devouring fire from His mouth Coals were kindled by it
He bowed the heavens also and came down With darkness under His feet
And He rode upon a cherub and flew He flew upon the wings of the wind
He made darkness His secret place His canopy around Him was dark waters And thick clouds of the skies
From the brightness before Him His thick clouds passed with hailstones and coals of fire
The LORD thundered from heaven And the Most High u ered His voice Hailstones and coals of fire
He sent out His arrows and sca ered the foe Lightnings in abundance and He vanquished them
Then the channels of the sea were seen The founda ons of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke O LORD At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils
He sent from above He took me He drew me out of many waters
He delivered me from my strong enemy From those who hated me For they were too strong for me
They confronted me in the day of my calamity But the LORD was my support
He also brought me out into a broad place He delivered me because He delighted in me
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me
For I have kept the ways of the LORD And have not wickedly departed from my God
For all His judgments were before me And I did not put away His statutes from me
I was also blameless before Him And I kept myself from my iniquity
Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight
With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless With the pure You will show Yourself pure And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd
For You will save the humble people But will bring down haughty looks
For You will light my lamp The LORD my God will enlighten my darkness
For by You I can run against a troop By my God I can leap over a wall
As for God His way is perfect The word of the LORD is proven He is a shield to all who trust in Him
For who is God except the LORD And who is a rock except our God It is God who arms me with strength And makes my way perfect
He makes my feet like the feet of deer And sets me on my high places
He teaches my hands to make war So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze
You have also given me the shield of Your salva on Your right hand has held me up Your gentleness has made me great
You enlarged my path under me So my feet did not slip
I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them Neither did I turn back again ll they were destroyed
I have wounded them So that they could not rise They have fallen under my feet
For You have armed me with strength for the ba le You have subdued under me those who rose up against me
You have also given me the necks of my enemies So that I destroyed those who hated me
They cried out but there was none to save Even to the LORD but He did not answer them
Then I beat them as fine as the dust before the wind I cast them out like dirt in the streets
You have delivered me from the strivings of the people You have made me the head of the na ons A people I have not known shall serve me
As soon as they hear of me they obey me The foreigners submit to me
The foreigners fade away And come frightened from their hideouts
The LORD lives Blessed be my Rock Let the God of my salva on be exalted
It is God who avenges me And subdues the peoples under me He delivers me from my enemies
You also li me up above those who rise against me You have delivered me from the violent man
Therefore I will give thanks to You O LORD among the Gen les And sing praises to Your name
Great deliverance He gives to His king And shows mercy to His anointed To David and his descendants forevermore
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
The heavens declare the glory of God And the firmament shows His handiwork
Day unto day u ers speech And night unto night reveals knowledge
There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard
Their line has gone out through all the earth And their words to the end of the world
In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber And rejoices like a strong man to run its race
Its rising is from one end of heaven And its circuit to the other end And there is nothing hidden from its heat
The law of the LORD is perfect conver ng the soul The tes mony of the LORD is sure making wise the simple The statutes of the LORD are right rejoicing the heart The commandment of the LORD is pure enlightening the eyes The fear of the LORD is clean enduring forever The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether
More to be desired are they than gold Yea than much fine gold Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb
Moreover by them Your servant is warned And in keeping them there is great reward
Who can understand his errors Cleanse me from secret faults
Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins Let them not have dominion over me
Then I shall be blameless And I shall be innocent of great transgression
Let the words of my mouth and the medita on of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight O LORD my strength and my Redeemer
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble May the name of the God of Jacob defend you May He send you help from the sanctuary And strengthen you out of Zion May He remember all your offerings And accept your burnt sacrifice
Selah May He grant you according to your heart s desire And fulfill all your purpose
We will rejoice in your salva on And in the name of our God we will set up our banners May the LORD fulfill all your pe ons
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand
Some trust in chariots and some in horses But we will remember the name of the LORD our God
They have bowed down and fallen But we have risen and stand upright
Save LORD May the King answer us when we call
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
The king shall have joy in Your strength O LORD And in Your salva on how greatly shall he rejoice You have given him his heart s desire And have not withheld the request of his lips
Selah For You meet him with the blessings of goodness You set a crown of pure gold upon his head
He asked life from You and You gave it to him Length of days forever and ever
His glory is great in Your salva on Honor and majesty You have placed upon him
For You have made him most blessed forever You have made him exceedingly glad with Your presence
For the king trusts in the LORD And through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved
Your hand will find all Your enemies Your right hand will find those who hate You
You shall make them as a fiery oven in the me of Your anger The LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath And the fire shall devour them
Their offspring You shall destroy from the earth And their descendants from among the sons of men
For they intended evil against You They devised a plot which they are not able to perform
Therefore You will make them turn their back You will make ready Your arrows on Your string toward their faces
Be exalted O LORD in Your own strength We will sing and praise Your power
To the Chief Musician
Set to The Deer of the Dawn
A Psalm of David
My God My God why have You forsaken Me Why are You so far from helping Me And from the words of My groaning O My God I cry in the day me but You do not hear And in the night season and am not silent
But You are holy Enthroned in the praises of Israel
Our fathers trusted in You They trusted and You delivered them
They cried to You and were delivered They trusted in You and were not ashamed
But I am a worm and no man A reproach of men and despised by the people
All those who see Me ridicule Me They shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted in the LORD let Him rescue Him Let Him deliver Him since He delights in Him But You are He who took Me out of the womb You made Me trust while on My mother s breasts
I was cast upon You from birth
From My mother s womb You have been My God
Be not far from Me For trouble is near For there is none to help
Many bulls have surrounded Me Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled Me
They gape at Me with their mouths Like a raging and roaring lion
I am poured out like water And all My bones are out of joint My heart is like wax It has melted within Me
My strength is dried up like a potsherd And My tongue clings to My jaws You have brought Me to the dust of death
For dogs have surrounded Me The congrega on of the wicked has enclosed Me
They pierced My hands and My feet I can count all My bones
They look and stare at Me
They divide My garments among them And for My clothing they cast lots
But You O LORD do not be far from Me O My Strength hasten to help Me Deliver Me from the sword My precious life from the power of the dog
Save Me from the lion s mouth And from the horns of the wild oxen You have answered Me
I will declare Your name to My brethren In the midst of the assembly I will praise You
You who fear the LORD praise Him All you descendants of Jacob glorify Him And fear Him all you offspring of Israel For He has not despised nor abhorred the afflic on of the afflicted Nor has He hidden His face from Him But when He cried to Him He heard
My praise shall be of You in the great assembly I will pay My vows before those who fear Him
The poor shall eat and be sa sfied Those who seek Him will praise the LORD
Let your heart live forever All the ends of the world Shall remember and turn to the LORD And all the families of the na ons Shall worship before You
For the kingdom is the LORD S And He rules over the na ons
All the prosperous of the earth Shall eat and worship All those who go down to the dust Shall bow before Him Even he who cannot keep himself alive
A posterity shall serve Him
It will be recounted of the Lord to the next genera on They will come and declare His righteousness to a people who will be born That He has done this
A Psalm of David
The LORD is my shepherd I shall not want
He makes me to lie down in green pastures He leads me beside the s ll waters
He restores my soul He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name s sake
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil For You are with me Your rod and Your staff they comfort me
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies You anoint my head with oil My cup runs over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life And I will dwell in the house of the LORD Forever
A Psalm of David
The earth is the LORD S and all its fullness The world and those who dwell therein
For He has founded it upon the seas And established it upon the waters
Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD Or who may stand in His holy place He who has clean hands and a pure heart Who has not li ed up his soul to an idol Nor sworn decei ully
He shall receive blessing from the LORD And righteousness from the God of his salva on
This is Jacob the genera on of those who seek Him Who seek Your face
Selah Li up your heads O you gates And be li ed up you everlas ng doors And the King of glory shall come in
Who is this King of glory The LORD strong and mighty The LORD mighty in ba le
Li up your heads O you gates Li up you everlas ng doors And the King of glory shall come in
Who is this King of glory The LORD of hosts He is the King of glory
Selah A Psalm of David
To You O LORD I li up my soul
O my God I trust in You Let me not be ashamed Let not my enemies triumph over me
Indeed let no one who waits on You be ashamed Let those be ashamed who deal treacherously without cause
Show me Your ways O LORD Teach me Your paths
Lead me in Your truth and teach me For You are the God of my salva on On You I wait all the day
Remember O LORD Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses For they are from of old
Do not remember the sins of my youth nor my transgressions According to Your mercy remember me For Your goodness sake O LORD
Good and upright is the LORD Therefore He teaches sinners in the way
The humble He guides in jus ce And the humble He teaches His way
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth To such as keep His covenant and His tes monies
For Your name s sake O LORD Pardon my iniquity for it is great
Who is the man that fears the LORD Him shall He teach in the way He chooses
He himself shall dwell in prosperity And his descendants shall inherit the earth
The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him And He will show them His covenant
My eyes are ever toward the LORD For He shall pluck my feet out of the net
Turn Yourself to me and have mercy on me For I am desolate and afflicted
The troubles of my heart have enlarged Bring me out of my distresses Look on my afflic on and my pain And forgive all my sins
Consider my enemies for they are many And they hate me with cruel hatred
Keep my soul and deliver me Let me not be ashamed for I put my trust in You
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me For I wait for You
Redeem Israel O God Out of all their troubles A Psalm of David
Vindicate me O LORD For I have walked in my integrity
I have also trusted in the LORD I shall not slip
Examine me O LORD and prove me Try my mind and my heart
For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes And I have walked in Your truth
I have not sat with idolatrous mortals Nor will I go in with hypocrites
I have hated the assembly of evildoers And will not sit with the wicked
I will wash my hands in innocence So I will go about Your altar O LORD That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving And tell of all Your wondrous works
LORD I have loved the habita on of Your house And the place where Your glory dwells
Do not gather my soul with sinners Nor my life with bloodthirsty men In whose hands is a sinister scheme And whose right hand is full of bribes
But as for me I will walk in my integrity Redeem me and be merciful to me
My foot stands in an even place In the congrega ons I will bless the LORD
A Psalm of David
The LORD is my light and my salva on Whom shall I fear The LORD is the strength of my life Of whom shall I be afraid When the wicked came against me To eat up my flesh My enemies and foes They stumbled and fell
Though an army may encamp against me My heart shall not fear Though war should rise against me In this I will be confident
One thing I have desired of the LORD That will I seek That I may dwell in the house of the LORD All the days of my life To behold the beauty of the LORD And to inquire in His temple
For in the me of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me He shall set me high upon a rock
And now my head shall be li ed up above my enemies all around me Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle I will sing yes I will sing praises to the LORD
Hear O LORD when I cry with my voice Have mercy also upon me and answer me
When You said Seek My face My heart said to You Your face LORD I will seek
Do not hide Your face from me Do not turn Your servant away in anger You have been my help Do not leave me nor forsake me O God of my salva on
When my father and my mother forsake me Then the LORD will take care of me
Teach me Your way O LORD And lead me in a smooth path because of my enemies
Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries For false witnesses have risen against me And such as breathe out violence
I would have lost heart unless I had believed That I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living
Wait on the LORD Be of good courage And He shall strengthen your heart Wait I say on the LORD A Psalm of David
To You I will cry O LORD my Rock Do not be silent to me Lest if You are silent to me I become like those who go down to the pit
Hear the voice of my supplica ons When I cry to You When I li up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary
Do not take me away with the wicked And with the workers of iniquity Who speak peace to their neighbors But evil is in their hearts
Give them according to their deeds And according to the wickedness of their endeavors Give them according to the work of their hands Render to them what they deserve
Because they do not regard the works of the LORD Nor the opera on of His hands He shall destroy them And not build them up
Blessed be the LORD Because He has heard the voice of my supplica ons The LORD is my strength and my shield My heart trusted in Him and I am helped Therefore my heart greatly rejoices And with my song I will praise Him
The LORD is their strength And He is the saving refuge of His anointed
Save Your people And bless Your inheritance Shepherd them also And bear them up forever
A Psalm of David
Give unto the LORD O you mighty ones Give unto the LORD glory and strength
Give unto the LORD the glory due to His name Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness
The voice of the LORD is over the waters The God of glory thunders The LORD is over many waters
The voice of the LORD is powerful The voice of the LORD is full of majesty
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars Yes the LORD splinters the cedars of Lebanon
He makes them also skip like a calf Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox
The voice of the LORD divides the flames of fire
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness The LORD shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh
The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth And strips the forests bare And in His temple everyone says Glory The LORD sat enthroned at the Flood And the LORD sits as King forever
The LORD will give strength to His people The LORD will bless His people with peace
A Psalm
A Song at the dedica on of the house of David
I will extol You O LORD for You have li ed me up And have not let my foes rejoice over me
O LORD my God I cried out to You And You healed me
O LORD You brought my soul up from the grave You have kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit
Sing praise to the LORD You saints of His And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name
For His anger is but for a moment His favor is for life Weeping may endure for a night But joy comes in the morning
Now in my prosperity I said I shall never be moved
LORD by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong You hid Your face and I was troubled
I cried out to You O LORD And to the LORD I made supplica on What profit is there in my blood When I go down to the pit Will the dust praise You Will it declare Your truth Hear O LORD and have mercy on me LORD be my helper You have turned for me my mourning into dancing You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness To the end that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent
O LORD my God I will give thanks to You forever
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
In You O LORD I put my trust Let me never be ashamed Deliver me in Your righteousness
Bow down Your ear to me Deliver me speedily Be my rock of refuge A fortress of defense to save me
For You are my rock and my fortress Therefore for Your name s sake Lead me and guide me
Pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me For You are my strength
Into Your hand I commit my spirit You have redeemed me O LORD God of truth
I have hated those who regard useless idols But I trust in the LORD
I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy For You have considered my trouble You have known my soul in adversi es And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy You have set my feet in a wide place
Have mercy on me O LORD for I am in trouble My eye wastes away with grief Yes my soul and my body For my life is spent with grief And my years with sighing My strength fails because of my iniquity And my bones waste away
I am a reproach among all my enemies But especially among my neighbors And am repulsive to my acquaintances Those who see me outside flee from me
I am forgo en like a dead man out of mind I am like a broken vessel
For I hear the slander of many Fear is on every side While they take counsel together against me They scheme to take away my life
But as for me I trust in You O LORD I say You are my God
My mes are in Your hand Deliver me from the hand of my enemies And from those who persecute me
Make Your face shine upon Your servant Save me for Your mercies sake
Do not let me be ashamed O LORD for I have called upon You Let the wicked be ashamed Let them be silent in the grave
Let the lying lips be put to silence Which speak insolent things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous
Oh how great is Your goodness Which You have laid up for those who fear You Which You have prepared for those who trust in You In the presence of the sons of men You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence From the plots of man You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion From the strife of tongues
Blessed be the LORD For He has shown me His marvelous kindness in a strong city For I said in my haste I am cut off from before Your eyes Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplica ons When I cried out to You
Oh love the LORD all you His saints For the LORD preserves the faithful And fully repays the proud person
Be of good courage And He shall strengthen your heart All you who hope in the LORD
A Psalm of David
A Contempla on
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven Whose sin is covered
Blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity And in whose spirit there is no deceit
When I kept silent my bones grew old Through my groaning all the day long
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me My vitality was turned into the drought of summer
Selah I acknowledged my sin to You And my iniquity I have not hidden
I said I will confess my transgressions to the LORD And You forgave the iniquity of my sin
Selah For this cause everyone who is godly shall pray to You In a me when You may be found Surely in a flood of great waters They shall not come near him
You are my hiding place You shall preserve me from trouble You shall surround me with songs of deliverance
Selah I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go I will guide you with My eye
Do not be like the horse or like the mule Which have no understanding Which must be harnessed with bit and bridle Else they will not come near you
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked But he who trusts in the LORD mercy shall surround him
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice you righteous And shout for joy all you upright in heart Rejoice in the LORD O you righteous For praise from the upright is beau ful
Praise the LORD with the harp Make melody to Him with an instrument of ten strings
Sing to Him a new song Play skillfully with a shout of joy
For the word of the LORD is right And all His work is done in truth
He loves righteousness and jus ce The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap He lays up the deep in storehouses
Let all the earth fear the LORD Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him
For He spoke and it was done He commanded and it stood fast
The LORD brings the counsel of the na ons to nothing He makes the plans of the peoples of no effect
The counsel of the LORD stands forever The plans of His heart to all genera ons
Blessed is the na on whose God is the LORD The people He has chosen as His own inheritance
The LORD looks from heaven He sees all the sons of men
From the place of His dwelling He looks On all the inhabitants of the earth He fashions their hearts individually He considers all their works
No king is saved by the mul tude of an army A mighty man is not delivered by great strength
A horse is a vain hope for safety Neither shall it deliver any by its great strength
Behold the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him On those who hope in His mercy To deliver their soul from death And to keep them alive in famine
Our soul waits for the LORD He is our help and our shield
For our heart shall rejoice in Him Because we have trusted in His holy name
Let Your mercy O LORD be upon us Just as we hope in You
A Psalm of David when he pretended madness before Abimelech who drove him away and he departed
I will bless the LORD at all mes His praise shall con nually be in my mouth
My soul shall make its boast in the LORD The humble shall hear of it and be glad
Oh magnify the LORD with me And let us exalt His name together
I sought the LORD and He heard me And delivered me from all my fears
They looked to Him and were radiant And their faces were not ashamed
This poor man cried out and the LORD heard him And saved him out of all his troubles
The angel of the LORD encamps all around those who fear Him And delivers them
Oh taste and see that the LORD is good Blessed is the man who trusts in Him Oh fear the LORD you His saints There is no want to those who fear Him
The young lions lack and suffer hunger But those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing
Come you children listen to me I will teach you the fear of the LORD
Who is the man who desires life And loves many days that he may see good Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit
Depart from evil and do good Seek peace and pursue it
The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous And His ears are open to their cry
The face of the LORD is against those who do evil To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth
The righteous cry out and the LORD hears And delivers them out of all their troubles
The LORD is near to those who have a broken heart And saves such as have a contrite spirit
Many are the afflic ons of the righteous But the LORD delivers him out of them all
He guards all his bones Not one of them is broken
Evil shall slay the wicked And those who hate the righteous shall be condemned
The LORD redeems the soul of His servants And none of those who trust in Him shall be condemned
A Psalm of David
Plead my cause O LORD with those who strive with me Fight against those who fight against me
Take hold of shield and buckler And stand up for my help
Also draw out the spear And stop those who pursue me
Say to my soul I am your salva on
Let those be put to shame and brought to dishonor Who seek a er my life Let those be turned back and brought to confusion Who plot my hurt
Let them be like chaff before the wind And let the angel of the LORD chase them
Let their way be dark and slippery And let the angel of the LORD pursue them
For without cause they have hidden their net for me in a pit Which they have dug without cause for my life
Let destruc on come upon him unexpectedly And let his net that he has hidden catch himself Into that very destruc on let him fall
And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD It shall rejoice in His salva on
All my bones shall say LORD who is like You Delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him Yes the poor and the needy from him who plunders him Fierce witnesses rise up They ask me things that I do not know
They reward me evil for good To the sorrow of my soul
But as for me when they were sick My clothing was sackcloth I humbled myself with fas ng And my prayer would return to my own heart
I paced about as though he were my friend or brother I bowed down heavily as one who mourns for his mother
But in my adversity they rejoiced And gathered together A ackers gathered against me And I did not know it They tore at me and did not cease With ungodly mockers at feasts They gnashed at me with their teeth
Lord how long will You look on Rescue me from their destruc ons My precious life from the lions
I will give You thanks in the great assembly I will praise You among many people
Let them not rejoice over me who are wrongfully my enemies Nor let them wink with the eye who hate me without a cause
For they do not speak peace But they devise decei ul ma ers Against the quiet ones in the land
They also opened their mouth wide against me And said Aha aha Our eyes have seen it
This You have seen O LORD Do not keep silence
O Lord do not be far from me
S r up Yourself and awake to my vindica on To my cause my God and my Lord
Vindicate me O LORD my God according to Your righteousness And let them not rejoice over me
Let them not say in their hearts Ah so we would have it Let them not say We have swallowed him up
Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion Who rejoice at my hurt Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor Who exalt themselves against me
Let them shout for joy and be glad Who favor my righteous cause And let them say con nually Let the LORD be magnified Who has pleasure in the prosperity of His servant
And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness And of Your praise all the day long
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD
An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked There is no fear of God before his eyes
For he fla ers himself in his own eyes When he finds out his iniquity and when he hates
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit He has ceased to be wise and to do good
He devises wickedness on his bed He sets himself in a way that is not good He does not abhor evil
Your mercy O LORD is in the heavens Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
Your righteousness is like the great mountains Your judgments are a great deep O LORD You preserve man and beast
How precious is Your lovingkindness O God Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings
They are abundantly sa sfied with the fullness of Your house And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures
For with You is the fountain of life In Your light we see light
Oh con nue Your lovingkindness to those who know You And Your righteousness to the upright in heart
Let not the foot of pride come against me And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away
There the workers of iniquity have fallen They have been cast down and are not able to rise
A Psalm of David
Do not fret because of evildoers Nor be envious of the workers of iniquity
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass And wither as the green herb
Trust in the LORD and do good Dwell in the land and feed on His faithfulness
Delight yourself also in the LORD And He shall give you the desires of your heart
Commit your way to the LORD Trust also in Him And He shall bring it to pass
He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light And your jus ce as the noonday
Rest in the LORD and wait pa ently for Him Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass
Cease from anger and forsake wrath Do not fret it only causes harm
For evildoers shall be cut off But those who wait on the LORD They shall inherit the earth
For yet a li le while and the wicked shall be no more Indeed you will look carefully for his place But it shall be no more
But the meek shall inherit the earth And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace
The wicked plots against the just And gnashes at him with his teeth
The Lord laughs at him For He sees that his day is coming
The wicked have drawn the sword And have bent their bow To cast down the poor and needy To slay those who are of upright conduct
Their sword shall enter their own heart And their bows shall be broken
A li le that a righteous man has Is be er than the riches of many wicked
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken But the LORD upholds the righteous
The LORD knows the days of the upright And their inheritance shall be forever
They shall not be ashamed in the evil me And in the days of famine they shall be sa sfied
But the wicked shall perish And the enemies of the LORD Like the splendor of the meadows shall vanish
Into smoke they shall vanish away
The wicked borrows and does not repay But the righteous shows mercy and gives
For those blessed by Him shall inherit the earth But those cursed by Him shall be cut off
The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD And He delights in his way
Though he fall he shall not be u erly cast down For the LORD upholds him with His hand
I have been young and now am old Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken Nor his descendants begging bread
He is ever merciful and lends And his descendants are blessed
Depart from evil and do good And dwell forevermore
For the LORD loves jus ce And does not forsake His saints They are preserved forever But the descendants of the wicked shall be cut off
The righteous shall inherit the land And dwell in it forever
The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom And his tongue talks of jus ce
The law of his God is in his heart None of his steps shall slide
The wicked watches the righteous And seeks to slay him
The LORD will not leave him in his hand Nor condemn him when he is judged
Wait on the LORD And keep His way And He shall exalt you to inherit the land When the wicked are cut off you shall see it
I have seen the wicked in great power And spreading himself like a na ve green tree
Yet he passed away and behold he was no more Indeed I sought him but he could not be found
Mark the blameless man and observe the upright For the future of that man is peace
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together The future of the wicked shall be cut off
But the salva on of the righteous is from the LORD He is their strength in the me of trouble
And the LORD shall help them and deliver them He shall deliver them from the wicked And save them Because they trust in Him
A Psalm of David
To bring to remembrance
O LORD do not rebuke me in Your wrath Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure For Your arrows pierce me deeply And Your hand presses me down
There is no soundness in my flesh Because of Your anger Nor any health in my bones Because of my sin
For my iniqui es have gone over my head Like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me
My wounds are foul and festering Because of my foolishness
I am troubled I am bowed down greatly I go mourning all the day long
For my loins are full of inflamma on And there is no soundness in my flesh
I am feeble and severely broken I groan because of the turmoil of my heart
Lord all my desire is before You And my sighing is not hidden from You
My heart pants my strength fails me As for the light of my eyes it also has gone from me
My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague And my rela ves stand afar off
Those also who seek my life lay snares for me Those who seek my hurt speak of destruc on And plan decep on all the day long
But I like a deaf man do not hear And I am like a mute who does not open his mouth
Thus I am like a man who does not hear And in whose mouth is no response
For in You O LORD I hope You will hear O Lord my God
For I said Hear me lest they rejoice over me Lest when my foot slips they exalt themselves against me
For I am ready to fall And my sorrow is con nually before me
For I will declare my iniquity I will be in anguish over my sin
But my enemies are vigorous and they are strong And those who hate me wrongfully have mul plied
Those also who render evil for good They are my adversaries because I follow what is good
Do not forsake me O LORD O my God be not far from me Make haste to help me O Lord my salva on To the Chief Musician
To Jeduthun
A Psalm of David
I said I will guard my ways Lest I sin with my tongue I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle While the wicked are before me
I was mute with silence I held my peace even from good And my sorrow was s rred up
My heart was hot within me While I was musing the fire burned
Then I spoke with my tongue LORD make me to know my end And what is the measure of my days That I may know how frail I am
Indeed You have made my days as handbreadths And my age is as nothing before You Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor
Selah Surely every man walks about like a shadow Surely they busy themselves in vain He heaps up riches And does not know who will gather them
And now Lord what do I wait for My hope is in You
Deliver me from all my transgressions Do not make me the reproach of the foolish
I was mute I did not open my mouth Because it was You who did it
Remove Your plague from me I am consumed by the blow of Your hand
When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity You make his beauty melt away like a moth Surely every man is vapor
Selah Hear my prayer O LORD And give ear to my cry Do not be silent at my tears For I am a stranger with You A sojourner as all my fathers were
Remove Your gaze from me that I may regain strength Before I go away and am no more
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
I waited pa ently for the LORD And He inclined to me And heard my cry
He also brought me up out of a horrible pit Out of the miry clay And set my feet upon a rock And established my steps
He has put a new song in my mouth Praise to our God Many will see it and fear And will trust in the LORD
Blessed is that man who makes the LORD his trust And does not respect the proud nor such as turn aside to lies
Many O LORD my God are Your wonderful works Which You have done And Your thoughts toward us Cannot be recounted to You in order If I would declare and speak of them They are more than can be numbered
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire My ears You have opened
Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require
Then I said Behold I come In the scroll of the book it is wri en of me
I delight to do Your will O my God And Your law is within my heart
I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness In the great assembly Indeed I do not restrain my lips O LORD You Yourself know
I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salva on I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth From the great assembly
Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me O LORD Let Your lovingkindness and Your truth con nually preserve me
For innumerable evils have surrounded me My iniqui es have overtaken me so that I am not able to look up They are more than the hairs of my head Therefore my heart fails me
Be pleased O LORD to deliver me O LORD make haste to help me Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion Who seek to destroy my life Let them be driven backward and brought to dishonor Who wish me evil
Let them be confounded because of their shame Who say to me Aha aha Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You Let such as love Your salva on say con nually The LORD be magnified But I am poor and needy Yet the Lord thinks upon me
You are my help and my deliverer Do not delay O my God
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David
Blessed is he who considers the poor The LORD will deliver him in me of trouble
The LORD will preserve him and keep him alive And he will be blessed on the earth You will not deliver him to the will of his enemies
The LORD will strengthen him on his bed of illness You will sustain him on his sickbed
I said LORD be merciful to me Heal my soul for I have sinned against You
My enemies speak evil of me When will he die and his name perish And if he comes to see me he speaks lies His heart gathers iniquity to itself When he goes out he tells it
All who hate me whisper together against me Against me they devise my hurt
An evil disease they say clings to him
And now that he lies down he will rise up no more
Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted Who ate my bread Has li ed up his heel against me
But You O LORD be merciful to me and raise me up That I may repay them
By this I know that You are well pleased with me Because my enemy does not triumph over me
As for me You uphold me in my integrity And set me before Your face forever
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel From everlas ng to everlas ng Amen and Amen

A Contempla on of the sons of Korah
As the deer pants for the water brooks So pants my soul for You O God
My soul thirsts for God for the living God
When shall I come and appear before God My tears have been my food day and night While they con nually say to me Where is your God When I remember these things I pour out my soul within me
For I used to go with the mul tude I went with them to the house of God With the voice of joy and praise With a mul tude that kept a pilgrim feast
Why are you cast down O my soul And why are you disquieted within me Hope in God for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance
O my God my soul is cast down within me Therefore I will remember You from the land of the Jordan And from the heights of Hermon From the Hill Mizar
Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls All Your waves and billows have gone over me
The LORD will command His lovingkindness in the day me And in the night His song shall be with me A prayer to the God of my life
I will say to God my Rock Why have You forgo en me Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy As with a breaking of my bones My enemies reproach me While they say to me all day long Where is your God Why are you cast down O my soul And why are you disquieted within me Hope in God For I shall yet praise Him The help of my countenance and my God
Vindicate me O God And plead my cause against an ungodly na on Oh deliver me from the decei ul and unjust man For You are the God of my strength Why do You cast me off Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy Oh send out Your light and Your truth Let them lead me Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your tabernacle
Then I will go to the altar of God To God my exceeding joy And on the harp I will praise You O God my God
Why are you cast down O my soul And why are you disquieted within me Hope in God For I shall yet praise Him The help of my countenance and my God
To the Chief Musician
A Contempla on of the sons of Korah
We have heard with our ears O God Our fathers have told us The deeds You did in their days In days of old You drove out the na ons with Your hand But them You planted You afflicted the peoples and cast them out
For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword Nor did their own arm save them But it was Your right hand Your arm and the light of Your countenance Because You favored them
You are my King O God Command victories for Jacob
Through You we will push down our enemies Through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us
For I will not trust in my bow Nor shall my sword save me
But You have saved us from our enemies And have put to shame those who hated us
In God we boast all day long And praise Your name forever
Selah But You have cast us off and put us to shame And You do not go out with our armies
You make us turn back from the enemy And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves
You have given us up like sheep intended for food And have sca ered us among the na ons
You sell Your people for next to nothing And are not enriched by selling them
You make us a reproach to our neighbors A scorn and a derision to those all around us
You make us a byword among the na ons A shaking of the head among the peoples
My dishonor is con nually before me And the shame of my face has covered me Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles Because of the enemy and the avenger
All this has come upon us But we have not forgo en You Nor have we dealt falsely with Your covenant
Our heart has not turned back Nor have our steps departed from Your way But You have severely broken us in the place of jackals And covered us with the shadow of death
If we had forgo en the name of our God Or stretched out our hands to a foreign god Would not God search this out For He knows the secrets of the heart
Yet for Your sake we are killed all day long We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
Awake Why do You sleep O Lord Arise Do not cast us off forever
Why do You hide Your face And forget our afflic on and our oppression For our soul is bowed down to the dust Our body clings to the ground
Arise for our help And redeem us for Your mercies sake

A Song of Love
My heart is overflowing with a good theme I recite my composi on concerning the King My tongue is the pen of a ready writer
You are fairer than the sons of men Grace is poured upon Your lips Therefore God has blessed You forever
Gird Your sword upon Your thigh O Mighty One With Your glory and Your majesty
And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth humility and righteousness And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King s enemies The peoples fall under You
Your throne O God is forever and ever A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom
You love righteousness and hate wickedness Therefore God Your God has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions
All Your garments are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia Out of the ivory palaces by which they have made You glad
Kings daughters are among Your honorable women At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir
Listen O daughter Consider and incline your ear Forget your own people also and your father s house So the King will greatly desire your beauty Because He is your Lord worship Him
And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gi The rich among the people will seek your favor
The royal daughter is all glorious within the palace Her clothing is woven with gold
She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors The virgins her companions who follow her shall be brought to You
With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought They shall enter the King s palace
Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons Whom You shall make princes in all the earth
I will make Your name to be remembered in all genera ons Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever

A Psalm of the sons of Korah
A Song for Alamoth
God is our refuge and strength A very present help in trouble
Therefore we will not fear Even though the earth be removed And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea Though its waters roar and be troubled Though the mountains shake with its swelling
Selah There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God The holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High
God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her just at the break of dawn
The na ons raged the kingdoms were moved He u ered His voice the earth melted
The LORD of hosts is with us The God of Jacob is our refuge
Selah Come behold the works of the LORD Who has made desola ons in the earth
He makes wars cease to the end of the earth He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two He burns the chariot in the fire
Be s ll and know that I am God I will be exalted among the na ons I will be exalted in the earth The LORD of hosts is with us The God of Jacob is our refuge
Selah To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of the sons of Korah
Oh clap your hands all you peoples Shout to God with the voice of triumph For the LORD Most High is awesome He is a great King over all the earth
He will subdue the peoples under us And the na ons under our feet
He will choose our inheritance for us The excellence of Jacob whom He loves
Selah God has gone up with a shout The LORD with the sound of a trumpet
Sing praises to God sing praises Sing praises to our King sing praises For God is the King of all the earth Sing praises with understanding
God reigns over the na ons God sits on His holy throne
The princes of the people have gathered together The people of the God of Abraham
For the shields of the earth belong to God He is greatly exalted
A Song
A Psalm of the sons of Korah
Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised In the city of our God In His holy mountain
Beau ful in eleva on The joy of the whole earth Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north The city of the great King
God is in her palaces He is known as her refuge
For behold the kings assembled They passed by together
They saw it and so they marveled They were troubled they hastened away
Fear took hold of them there And pain as of a woman in birth pangs As when You break the ships of Tarshish With an east wind
As we have heard So we have seen In the city of the LORD of hosts In the city of our God God will establish it forever
Selah We have thought O God on Your lovingkindness In the midst of Your temple
According to Your name O God So is Your praise to the ends of the earth Your right hand is full of righteousness
Let Mount Zion rejoice Let the daughters of Judah be glad Because of Your judgments
Walk about Zion And go all around her
Count her towers Mark well her bulwarks Consider her palaces That you may tell it to the genera on following
For this is God Our God forever and ever He will be our guide Even to death
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of the sons of Korah
Hear this all peoples Give ear all inhabitants of the world Both low and high Rich and poor together
My mouth shall speak wisdom And the medita on of my heart shall give understanding
I will incline my ear to a proverb I will disclose my dark saying on the harp
Why should I fear in the days of evil When the iniquity at my heels surrounds me Those who trust in their wealth And boast in the mul tude of their riches None of them can by any means redeem his brother Nor give to God a ransom for him For the redemp on of their souls is costly And it shall cease forever That he should con nue to live eternally And not see the Pit
For he sees wise men die Likewise the fool and the senseless person perish And leave their wealth to others
Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever Their dwelling places to all genera ons They call their lands a er their own names
Nevertheless man though in honor does not remain He is like the beasts that perish
This is the way of those who are foolish And of their posterity who approve their sayings
Selah Like sheep they are laid in the grave Death shall feed on them The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning And their beauty shall be consumed in the grave far from their dwelling
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave For He shall receive me
Selah Do not be afraid when one becomes rich When the glory of his house is increased For when he dies he shall carry nothing away His glory shall not descend a er him
Though while he lives he blesses himself For men will praise you when you do well for yourself He shall go to the genera on of his fathers They shall never see light
A man who is in honor yet does not understand Is like the beasts that perish
A Psalm of Asaph
The Mighty One God the LORD Has spoken and called the earth From the rising of the sun to its going down
Out of Zion the perfec on of beauty God will shine forth
Our God shall come and shall not keep silent A fire shall devour before Him And it shall be very tempestuous all around Him
He shall call to the heavens from above And to the earth that He may judge His people Gather My saints together to Me Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice
Let the heavens declare His righteousness For God Himself is Judge
Selah Hear O My people and I will speak O Israel and I will tes fy against you I am God your God I will not rebuke you for your sacrifices Or your burnt offerings Which are con nually before Me
I will not take a bull from your house Nor goats out of your folds
For every beast of the forest is Mine And the ca le on a thousand hills
I know all the birds of the mountains And the wild beasts of the field are Mine
If I were hungry I would not tell you For the world is Mine and all its fullness
Will I eat the flesh of bulls Or drink the blood of goats Offer to God thanksgiving And pay your vows to the Most High
Call upon Me in the day of trouble I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me
But to the wicked God says What right have you to declare My statutes Or take My covenant in your mouth Seeing you hate instruc on And cast My words behind you When you saw a thief you consented with him And have been a partaker with adulterers
You give your mouth to evil And your tongue frames deceit
You sit and speak against your brother You slander your own mother s son
These things you have done and I kept silent You thought that I was altogether like you But I will rebuke you And set them in order before your eyes
Now consider this you who forget God Lest I tear you in pieces And there be none to deliver Whoever offers praise glorifies Me And to him who orders his conduct aright I will show the salva on of God
To the Chief Musician
A Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet went to him a er he had gone in to Bathsheba
Have mercy upon me O God According to Your lovingkindness According to the mul tude of Your tender mercies Blot out my transgressions
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity And cleanse me from my sin
For I acknowledge my transgressions And my sin is always before me
Against You You only have I sinned And done this evil in Your sight That You may be found just when You speak And blameless when You judge
Behold I was brought forth in iniquity And in sin my mother conceived me
Behold You desire truth in the inward parts And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom
Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
Make me hear joy and gladness That the bones You have broken may rejoice
Hide Your face from my sins And blot out all my iniqui es
Create in me a clean heart O God And renew a steadfast spirit within me
Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me
Restore to me the joy of Your salva on And uphold me by Your generous Spirit
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways And sinners shall be converted to You
Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed O God The God of my salva on And my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness
O Lord open my lips And my mouth shall show forth Your praise
For You do not desire sacrifice or else I would give it You do not delight in burnt offering
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit A broken and a contrite heart These O God You will not despise
Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion Build the walls of Jerusalem
Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness With burnt offering and whole burnt offering Then they shall offer bulls on Your altar
To the Chief Musician
A Contempla on of David when Doeg the Edomite went and told Saul and said to him David has gone to the house of Ahimelech
Why do you boast in evil O mighty man The goodness of God endures con nually
Your tongue devises destruc on Like a sharp razor working decei ully
You love evil more than good Lying rather than speaking righteousness
Selah You love all devouring words You decei ul tongue
God shall likewise destroy you forever He shall take you away and pluck you out of your dwelling place And uproot you from the land of the living
Selah The righteous also shall see and fear And shall laugh at him saying Here is the man who did not make God his strength But trusted in the abundance of his riches And strengthened himself in his wickedness
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever
I will praise You forever Because You have done it And in the presence of Your saints I will wait on Your name for it is good

Set to Mahalath
A Contempla on of David
The fool has said in his heart There is no God
They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity There is none who does good
God looks down from heaven upon the children of men To see if there are any who understand who seek God
Every one of them has turned aside They have together become corrupt There is none who does good No not one
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge Who eat up my people as they eat bread And do not call upon God There they are in great fear Where no fear was For God has sca ered the bones of him who encamps against you You have put them to shame Because God has despised them
Oh that the salva on of Israel would come out of Zion When God brings back the cap vity of His people Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad

A Contempla on of David when the Ziphites went and said to Saul Is David not hiding with us Save me O God by Your name And vindicate me by Your strength
Hear my prayer O God Give ear to the words of my mouth
For strangers have risen up against me And oppressors have sought a er my life They have not set God before them
Selah Behold God is my helper The Lord is with those who uphold my life
He will repay my enemies for their evil
Cut them off in Your truth
I will freely sacrifice to You I will praise Your name O LORD for it is good
For He has delivered me out of all trouble And my eye has seen its desire upon my enemies
To the Chief Musician
With stringed instruments
A Contempla on of David
Give ear to my prayer O God And do not hide Yourself from my supplica on
A end to me and hear me I am restless in my complaint and moan noisily Because of the voice of the enemy Because of the oppression of the wicked For they bring down trouble upon me And in wrath they hate me
My heart is severely pained within me And the terrors of death have fallen upon me
Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me And horror has overwhelmed me
So I said Oh that I had wings like a dove I would fly away and be at rest
Indeed I would wander far off And remain in the wilderness
Selah I would hasten my escape From the windy storm and tempest
Destroy O Lord and divide their tongues For I have seen violence and strife in the city
Day and night they go around it on its walls Iniquity and trouble are also in the midst of it
Destruc on is in its midst Oppression and deceit do not depart from its streets
For it is not an enemy who reproaches me Then I could bear it
Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me Then I could hide from him
But it was you a man my equal My companion and my acquaintance
We took sweet counsel together And walked to the house of God in the throng
Let death seize them Let them go down alive into hell For wickedness is in their dwellings and among them
As for me I will call upon God And the LORD shall save me
Evening and morning and at noon I will pray and cry aloud And He shall hear my voice
He has redeemed my soul in peace from the ba le that was against me For there were many against me
God will hear and afflict them Even He who abides from of old
Selah Because they do not change Therefore they do not fear God
He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him He has broken his covenant
The words of his mouth were smoother than bu er But war was in his heart His words were so er than oil Yet they were drawn swords
Cast your burden on the LORD And He shall sustain you He shall never permit the righteous to be moved
But You O God shall bring them down to the pit of destruc on Bloodthirsty and decei ul men shall not live out half their days But I will trust in You

A Michtam of David when the Philis nes captured him in Gath
Be merciful to me O God for man would swallow me up Figh ng all day he oppresses me
My enemies would hound me all day For there are many who fight against me O Most High
Whenever I am afraid I will trust in You
In God I will praise His word In God I have put my trust I will not fear
What can flesh do to me All day they twist my words All their thoughts are against me for evil
They gather together They hide they mark my steps When they lie in wait for my life
Shall they escape by iniquity In anger cast down the peoples O God You number my wanderings Put my tears into Your bo le Are they not in Your book When I cry out to You Then my enemies will turn back This I know because God is for me
In God I will praise His word In the LORD I will praise His word In God I have put my trust I will not be afraid
What can man do to me Vows made to You are binding upon me O God I will render praises to You For You have delivered my soul from death
Have You not kept my feet from falling That I may walk before God In the light of the living To the Chief Musician

A Michtam of David when he fled from Saul into the cave
Be merciful to me O God be merciful to me For my soul trusts in You And in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge Un l these calami es have passed by
I will cry out to God Most High To God who performs all things for me
He shall send from heaven and save me He reproaches the one who would swallow me up
Selah God shall send forth His mercy and His truth
My soul is among lions I lie among the sons of men Who are set on fire Whose teeth are spears and arrows And their tongue a sharp sword
Be exalted O God above the heavens Let Your glory be above all the earth
They have prepared a net for my steps My soul is bowed down They have dug a pit before me Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen
Selah My heart is steadfast O God my heart is steadfast I will sing and give praise
Awake my glory Awake lute and harp I will awaken the dawn
I will praise You O Lord among the peoples I will sing to You among the na ons
For Your mercy reaches unto the heavens And Your truth unto the clouds
Be exalted O God above the heavens Let Your glory be above all the earth
